            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Their names are concealed of purpoſe to quench, or at the

            <p>Upon the reading of the Letter above ſaid, the Authour took
pen and paper and <hi>immediately</hi> went about to anſwer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
and expectations of his friends, and when it was writ, it
was much deſired to be put in print, for eaſe in reading, and

the Authour <hi>in point of conſcience and worſhip of God,</hi> and laid
things to his charge which never man heard from him<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 5. 11. Pſal. 56. 5.</note>, but
in many things directly contrarie to that which they affirmed,
and therefore was perſwaded beyond his own thoughts in the
writing of it, to let it go to the preſſe, <hi>being that he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to write any thing privately to any in the matters of God, that
he would not freely publiſh before any in the world,</hi> knowing that
the Word of God is as free, ſupereminent, and void of all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
to take hold of everie heart in the world, as the Sun in
the firmament is in its courſe to take hold of every creature
here below on the earth, and manifeſt its operation upon the
ſame<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 19 4, 5 6. Rom. 10. 18 Rom. 13. 1, 2</note>, therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>let every ſoule bee ſubject to
the ſupereminent power,</hi> for ſo the word is rightly rendred, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
a power that depends upon nothing for ſupport, but
<hi>hath prerogative and priviledge over and above all, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

<pb facs="tcp:64158:8"/>
as all others do, though applyed according to the Letter<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 3 6</note>
to the Civill Magiſtrate, yet according to the life and ſpirit of
the Scripture it cannot have its proper ſcope and end in him,
for Chriſt is the end of all Law of relations in point of that
righteouſneſſe that indures for ever, which is in every one that
believes<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 10. 4</note>, ſo that the tranſlators ſometimes wrong the Text in

<hi>Put them in mind to be ſubject to principalities and powers, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey

               <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 8 6, 7, 8, 9.</note>, and as he is man, <hi>he ſubmits unto the will of the

               <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 622, 23.</note>, but
there is alſo in the Word of God <hi>a ſupereminency and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

               <note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 17 8. Pſal, 1. 3. Pſal. 122. 6, 7, 8.</note>; ſo that

               <note n="h" place="margin">Eſa. 8. 14, 15. Rom. 9. 33. 1 Pet. 2. 7, 8.</note>; for whoſoever takes upon him to redreſſe

               <note n="i" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6, 7.</note>, even as the Sun lendeth his beames unto the earth for

            <p>The occaſion then of penning of this Treatiſe, was M. <hi>John
Cotton</hi> his preaching, not giving ſatisfaction to all that heard
him upon this Pſalme: the ground of the printing of it is an
indifferent eye in the Authour unto all men in the things of
God, who deſires to manifeſt <hi>God to be true, and every man a
lyar</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note>, <hi>not having mens perſons in admiration for advantage</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Iud. 16.</note>
knowing <hi>that there is not one that doth good, no not one</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 3. 8.</note>, nor
fearing any that is not a <hi>lover of truth, for it is God that juſtifies,
who then ſhall condemne</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 8. 33</note>? For, <hi>truth makes free in the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<pb facs="tcp:64158:9"/>

               <hi>But the drift of this Treatiſe is, to ſet the Diadem upon the

reaſon of dividing of Hiſtories, propheſies, &amp; Epiſtles in the word

of the Hiſtory, Propheſies, or Epiſtle, ought to be gathered up, and
looked upon together, elſe the ſcope and drift, root and branch,

that is, the things that have paſſed through my heart and hand, in
way of the miniſtery of the Goſpel, they are forgotten, that is, they
are to me as though they had never been, in regard of any skill
or ability that is in me to gather them up, call them in, and bring
them into uſe again, either for my own profit and comfort, or for
the fruit and benefit of the Church, but am wholly at the good
will and pleaſure of him that gave them [in] at the firſt, to bring
them again, and to give them their proper meaſure, weight, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and glory in their return, according as they have their being

<pb facs="tcp:64158:11"/>
things out of the boſome of the father, at ſuch a diſtance (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet appeared unto them) no more can they of themſelves call
again any thing into preſent uſe, which hath formerly paſſed their
hands. Whence it is that the comforter hath that two-fold office,
not onely <hi>to teach and lead forth into all truth, but alſo to bring to our
remembrance the things that have been taught unto us</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Ioh, 14, 26.</note> which the

               <note n="y" place="margin">Ierem. 5. 31.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, obſerve diligently in this Treatiſe, that as it gives all
power and dominion unto the Son of God, <hi>both in heaven and in
earth:</hi> ſo it alſo gives (notwithſtanding) <hi>due authority to all civill
Magiſtrates, without which their right cannot be given unto them, if
their place and office be not bounded within the compaſſe and liſts of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
things.</hi> For Chriſts power and authority is ſpiritual<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 18. 36</note>; ſo that
if once the Magiſtrate be ingaged, <hi>by vertue of that his office, to
deale in the things of God, and to intermeddle between God and the
conſciences of men;</hi> he is then alſo bound over in conſcience, to
ſubdue to the uttermoſt of his power, all other civill States unto
himſelfe, <hi>and to engage them to ſerve and worſhip the ſame God he
ſerves, what ever Idoll he hath ſet up unto himſelfe, or his Leviticall
Preiſts have framed and faſhioned for him</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Dan. 3. Exod. 32.</note> and ſo muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
greed and endevour after the ſubjecting of all civill States unto
himſelfe, <hi>elſe doth he not deale faithfully with his God,</hi> which is the
very ſpirit that ſuggeſted the like temptation unto our Lord<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 4. 8. 9.</note>,
which ſpirit Antichriſt ever goeth forth in, <hi>and ſo ſets himſelfe in
the ſeat of God,</hi> and proves oppoſite to our Lord Chriſt, in all
things<note n="d" place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 3, 4.</note>. But keep the office of the Magiſtracie, (according to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety)
within the compaſſe of civill things, that is to have relation
to what ever concernes the relation between creature and creature
ſimply as they ſtand in reference one unto another in that reſpect;
and then in that way onely, it is the preſervation and honour of all
States in their ſeverall wayes of Rule and Government: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
there could but one government in the world, and all the
reſt muſt be cried own and ruinated; or if more ſtand, they muſt be
altogether diſhonorable. <hi>For where God is concined to appear in the
Magiſtracie, there the glory muſt be, and all other Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſhame and contempt.</hi> Yea the glory of that Prince that ſhould
ſubject all others to himſelfe, is made more diſhonorable then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb facs="tcp:64158:11"/>
it would be: For if he have not honorable Princes and
States, to converſe and commerce and negotiate with, his owne
Crown, Kingdome and People, cannot poſſibly beare that glory
and luſter which otherwiſe it would doe<note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 72, 10, 11. Iſa. 43. 3, 4. Pſal. 45. 9.</note>. And wee know, that
in reſpect of outward priviledges and glory that come by tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
deliverances, the Lord hath done to wicked and Heatheniſh
Nations the like things he did of old to Iſrael the people of God,
and therefore convinceth them thereof by the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi>
when they would have the glory of Religion to ariſe from ſuch
things<note n="f" place="margin">Amos 9, 7.</note>, ſaying, <hi>Are yee not as the AEthyopian unto me, O chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael? Have not I brought up Iſrael out of the Land of
AEgypt, ſaith the Lord, and the Philiſtines from Caphtor, and Aram</hi>
from <hi>Kir?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that by how much the civil Magiſtrate <hi>intereſts his office into
the Goſpel, as an order thereof,</hi> by ſo much hee doth arrogate unto
himſelf the glory of God, if things ſucceed wel: for unto Chriſt it
cannot be given, but as a generall hand of providence, which
reacheth to all Creatures: For his <hi>Kingdome, Rule, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
is not of this World<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 18. 36.</note>; but is <hi>Spirituall, as he himſelfe is
ſpirituall</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. Ioh. 4.</note>.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if any thing in this Book ſeeme dark, or doubtfull,
read it over and over, and peruſe the Scriptures alluded unto
in the Margent; and the oftner thou readeſt it, (if thy eye be
ſingle) the more light ſhall break forth<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 6. 22.</note>, and the more ſhall the
fruit appeare<note n="k" place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 9.</note>. Conferre the matter propounded, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
alluded unto, together, and the more thou ſoundeſt the
<hi>waters,</hi> the more they will ariſe, and the depth of them appeare<note n="l" place="margin">Ezek. 47.</note>,
to be waters of ſwimming, that none can paſſe over, but they ſhall
ſlow either in the way of life or death, in his conſcience, even as
the waters of <hi>Noah</hi> did<note n="m" place="margin">Iſai. 11. 9.</note>; and ſhall appeare to bee ſtrong and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to beare up the Ark of our ſpirituall <hi>Noah,</hi> for the ſaving of
that righteous one in every particular of his Family<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 7. 17. to 24. 1 Pet. 3. 20,</note>.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, again my advice unto thee is, that thou never
goe about to peruſe this, Booke, but when thy ſpirit is
retired, <hi>and drunk up by the grace of God</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note>, <hi>from the
cares and imployments of this life</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 13. 22. Luke 5. 14.</note>, as though thou hadſt nothing
elſe to doe but attend upon him <hi>that ſpeaks peace to his people, and
to his Saints, that they return not again to the folly</hi> of the things
<pb facs="tcp:64158:12"/>
of this preſſent life<note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 85. 8.</note>. And when thou ſees the hand of God upon
thee ſo, as though thou wert to converſe with him in prayer, thy
heart being diſpoſed to deale for the preſent with nothing, but in
an immediate and familiar converſing with him<note n="q" place="margin">Exod. 33. 11.</note>, and the hand
of his providence alſo making way thereunto, by ſetting the
creatures apart from being any interruption or obſtruction in this
preſent work and imployment: ſo ſhall the diſtillings of Him
appeare, <hi>who is as Deaw unto Iſrael, and cauſeth him to grow as a
Lilly, caſting forth his root and branches abundantly</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 6. 7</note>: and thy
ſmell ſhall be as <hi>Lebanon, and others ſhall return and delight to
dwell under thy ſhadow;</hi> yea they, (through this meanes and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
that is by Chriſt) ſhall revive as the corn, and flouriſh as
the vine, and the ſent thereof ſhall bee as the wine of <hi>Lebanon,</hi>
               <note n="s" place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 8.</note>,
and if this fruit be found upon thee<note n="t" place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 9.</note>, my reward is given into
my hand<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 10. 42. Mark 9. 41.</note>. For in deſiring I have deſired to ſee the life of the
Lord Jeſus in his elect, in all the wayes of his own adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and how am I pained till it be obſerved<note n="x" place="margin">Luke 12. 50.</note>! For that (as I have
reſpect unto this world) ſhall be the renewing of my ſtrength,
before I goe hence, and be no more<note n="y" place="margin">Pſa. 39. 13.</note>.</p>

Images and Idols, according to our own underſtanding, for theſe
things are the worke of the craftſ-men, even of old Demetrius and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64158:18"/>
his fellowes</hi> for <hi>they that are ſacrificers of men,</hi> that is, that dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
men unto God, holding one more holy, or ſtanding neerer
unto God, by his Office and place, then another, <hi>they Kiſſe the
Calves,</hi> that is, willingly ſubmit unto, and communicate with
that ſpirit of Idolatry, that ſet up a Calfe in the wilderneſſe, and
afterwards, one at <hi>Dan</hi> and another at <hi>Berſheba;</hi> even lovingly
imbrace Idols and Idolatry, as the glory of all their worſhip; See,
<hi>Hoſ,</hi> 13. 2. Read the margent from the Hebrew phraſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> having pronounced <hi>that all fleſh
is graſſe, and the glory of man as the flower of the field, and that
the word of the Lord abideth for ever;</hi> preſently inferres, that there
is no receiving of it, <hi>but as Babes</hi> freed from the deſire of
preheminence, <hi>not mixing the milke of the word with carnall
preferments of men,</hi> which ſhall vaniſh as the graſſe, bidding them
<hi>lay aſide all malice, guile, &amp; hypocriſie, envy, and evill ſpeaking,</hi> in
advancing men in the things of God; the word tranſlated <hi>malice,</hi>
ſignifies to viſiate or corrupt, to make ſick, or to make to dye;
even as ſuperfluous branches make a plant (as it were) ſick, and
unable to beare fruit, So is it with the plant of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they, breake forth, that preferre any in the Kingdome of
God before another: for they muſt either profeſſe Chriſt not
compleat, or elſe themſelves ſo ſet up ſuperfluous branches. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>So the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> after he hath concluded <hi>that every good
and perfect gift is from above, and comming down from the Father of
lights, in whom is no varying, no not ſo much as a ſhadow of change</hi>
but is the ſame in one, that he is in another; or elſe no gift
nor light of his: nor is it from above, but from below onely;
preſently inferres <hi>a laying aſide of all filthineſſe and ſuperfluity of
naughtineſſe,</hi> which is that luſt conceived in man, to advance him
ſelfe in the things of God, as that chapter and the whole Epiſtle
declareth, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 21. wherefore he preſently addes, <hi>receiving
with meekneſſe or lownineſſe the ingrafted word:</hi> the word <hi>ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
ſignifies an artificiall ſetting of one thing in another, which
by nature are foreigners and ſtrangers, as the holy word of the
Lord and all mens nature are, but wee know that difference of
perſons, offices, places, and degrees in the Churches, are no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64158:19"/>
ſtrangers nor forreiners unto mans nature; witneſſe the practice
of all peoples and Nations that are, or ever have been; who
have had onely nature to ſet them a worke, as at this day, we ſee
in theſe Natives amongſt whom wee live. Avoid therefore theſe
things as filthy and unclean, in the things of God, <hi>that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
touch but be defiled; and lop and out them off as ſuperfluous bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
not beſeeming the Vineyard of God, nor any plant that is of
our heavenly Fathers planting;</hi> if ever you intend to utter <hi>a Pſalm
of David, or ſing an acceptable Song or Hymne unto Almighty
God,</hi> who hath made himſelfe perfect and durable, in all things by
Chriſt, &amp; ſo wil remain &amp; abide the ſame, when theſe changeable
fleeting, deceitfull, and hypocriticall things of that man of ſinne,
and Son of perdition, ſhall vaniſh; and in ſhame and ignominie
goe down unto <hi>Sheoll,</hi> or that corrupting pit, for ever, Amen.
So much for the Title.</p>
            <p>The ſumme and ſcope of the Pſalm containes a deſcription of
that tranſcendent and co-equality of dignity that is in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and the Prieſtly offices of the Son of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Jeſus Chriſt our
Lord, even Jehovah our righteouſneſſe. Je. 23. 6.</p>
            <p>By which it evidently appeares, that the Phariſees of our dayes
are more ignorantly audacious then thoſe were in the dayes of
Chriſt: <hi>For when they profeſſe him to be the Son of David,</hi> Chriſt
knowing the blindneſſe of their minds in that poynt in reſpect of
the ſpirit and life of it, asked them from this. Pſalm, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.
<hi>If Chriſt be Davids ſonne, how doth David in ſpirit call him Lord?
ſaying, The Lord ſaid to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand untill
I make thy enemies thy. Foot-ſtoole:</hi> which our Phariſes can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
anſwer and ſay, He is <hi>Davids</hi> Lord according to his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and <hi>Davids ſonne</hi> according to his Humanity. But thoſe
Phariſees knew well enough, it was not an anſwer to Chriſt his
queſtion, nor could it be the intent of that phraſe in the Pſalem;
therefore they have ſo much modeſty as not to anſwer, though
they could not be ignorant of that anſwer which our Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
give; for it was the thing they ſtill looked for; yet they ſaw
his queſtion ſo farre beyond them; <hi>that they durſt not ask him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
queſtion after that.</hi> For they ſaw very well his queſtion was,
how he could be <hi>Davids</hi> Lord as he was his ſonne, and deſcended
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64158:19"/>
out of his loynes, as well as he was his Lord, as he made him to
be that which he was, namely a Lord and King himſelfe. For
they perceived his queſtion about his Son-ſhip to be ſpiritual, in
that he ſaith, <hi>How doth David in Spirit call him Lord?</hi> For Chriſt
as he is <hi>Davids</hi> ſon, is his Lord: for he is begotten, produced, and
brought forth by <hi>David,</hi> (or elſe he could not be) according to his
death) which death of his hath Lordſhip and Domination over
all fleſh in the glory of it, to bring it to nought, deſtroy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfit
it for ever: For the Son of God could not die, but in and
by becomming the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> by which death he overcomes
him that had the power of death, that is the Devill, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14,
If therefore the Phariſaicall Teachers of our times doe as farre
ſurpaſſe (thoſe) in cruelty, hardneſſe of heart, and hypocriſie, as
they doe in blindneſſe, audacious boldneſſe, and conſtancy therein:
Let thoſe onely that are ignorant of the Lord Jeſus, look for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and benefit by their ſociety and miniſtery; for to others it
yeeldeth none at all, but onely laying of ſnares, and practiſing of
treachery againſt the anointed of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. The Lord ſayd unto my Lord, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In theſe words of the Pſalm for order ſake, note theſe particulars:</p>
            <p>1. The manner of the Speech, or Phraſe, <hi>The Lord ſaid,</hi> or
<hi>aſſuredly ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Obſerve a two-fold Lordſhip, or an interchangeable Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<hi>The Lord ſaid to my Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The matter of the Speech, or Sentence, in theſe words,
<hi>Sit thou.</hi>

            <p>4. The place, condition, or ſtate to ſit in, noted in theſe
words, <hi>At my right hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The time how long this Royalty ſhall remain, <hi>Till I have
made thine enemies thy foot-ſtoole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the firſt, noted in theſe words,</hi> The Lord ſaid, or the Lord
avouched, or faithfully and aſſuredly ſaid;</p>
            <p>It is a word peculiar to the Oracle or Speech of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
1. 15 the like phraſe is uſed, and it is proper unto God onely to
utter himſelfe in ſuch an affirmation, becauſe the thing uttered
cannot comply with any earthly ſtate or condition whatſoever.
That the Authority and Lordſhip of a King, and the Lordly eſtate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64158:20"/>
and condition of a Prieſt, ſhould both conſiſt in one and the
ſame perſon or ſubſiſtence, in ſuch an extent <hi>as each of them
takes the right hand of allthings what ſo ever in heaven or in
earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Chriſt is Lord as he is <hi>Davids</hi> ſonne, deſcending out of his
loynes, and ſo becoming one with the nature of man in all points;
by which deſcenſion the humiliation of his Prieſtly office is ſuch,
<hi>that it takes the right hand of all:</hi> for it being <hi>the humiliation of
the ſonne of God, it muſt needs be of an infinite worth and value;</hi> and
there is <hi>but One Infinite:</hi> therefore it alone is ſet aloft and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
So that he is a Kingly Prieſt, as <hi>Melchiſedec was, Hebr.</hi> 7. 1.
and thence it is, that the <hi>Saints are a Kingdome of Prieſts, or a
Prieſthoods of Kings, 1 Pet.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>For there is not any thing <hi>that can get beynod that which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite:</hi>
and therefore his humiliation is <hi>eternized and perpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuated;</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
which the men of this world cannot endure to
heare of.</p>
            <p>But that which is of an eternall value, muſt alſo be eternall in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of time, and ſuch is the Prieſthood and humiliation of Jeſus
Chriſt: and that on this wiſe.</p>
            <p>Chriſt in taking our nature upon him, takes not unto himſelfe
any thing of excellency whatſoever: <hi>For he in no caſe taketh hold
on Angels,</hi> in way of our redemption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. that is, on any
excellency or dignity; for then he could not be the Son of God
(infinite in glory) if any excellency were added unto him. <hi>But
on the ſeed of Abraham he taketh hold,</hi> that is, of a poore and
mean condition, <hi>one that had not the bredth of a foot in the holy
land, Acts</hi> 7. 5. So that Chriſt in communicating with our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
takes unto himſelfe <hi>onely baſeneſſe, ignominy, and reproach,</hi>
and can no more receive any jot of glory in us, <hi>then we can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
receive any the leaſt ſtain or blemiſh by him:</hi> onely that which
man counts his honour, <hi>and is of higheſt eſteem in his own eyes,</hi> is
that <hi>which is truly baſe and abominable before God,</hi> Luke 16. 15.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64158:20"/>
and in that doth the humiliation of the Sonne of God conſiſt. For
the greateſt baſeneſſe before God, is, when man goeth about to
make himſelfe excellent and honourable by tranſitory and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
things; as by offices, places, gifts, riches and relations to this
preſent world; who by this meanes preferres and brings in the
excellencies of the <hi>Creature,</hi> above, and in ſtead of the glory and
dignity of the <hi>Creator,</hi> wherewith man was bleſſed at the firſt,
and through the ſame vitious deſire to exalt the creature, vilifies,
and ſo falls from his Creator: for the <hi>dignity and glory of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the glory of God the Creator, cannot ſubſiſt nor ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that which is infinite in it ſelfe admits not of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in co-partnerſhip or fellowſhip with it ſelfe; that is, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other in way of the ſame kind, or reſpect: as, if it be glory, it
is but one glory, or the glory of one; if it be ſhame, it is but
one ſhame, or the ſhame of one. So that of neceſſity the Sonne of
God aſſuming our nature, muſt burn up, waſte, cauſe to wither,
deſtroy, and conſume all the glory and goodlineſſe of man, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.
So that as duſt and aſhes, <hi>it falls into the aſh-pans of the Altar for
ever;</hi> and by conſuming of that, to wit, all the fat, the ſweet,
the firſtlings, chiefe and livelihood of the creature for
ever:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He brings in that firſt begotten of the Father, yea,
the Chiefty and Excellency of the Son of God. as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
perfumatory, a ſweet Savour, and of an eternall
acceptation with God,</hi> ſo long therefore as this one onely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
findes acceptation with God, ſo long is his humliation
and diſcention before God, for if he be exalted in the power
and dignity of God as he is the Sunne of man,<note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 5. 27.</note> ſo is he alſo
humbled and debaſed, in regard, of all excellency of man, as he
is the Sonne of God<note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 26. 7.</note> and ſo long as the one laſteth, ſo long
ſhall the other, for as Gods excellencies ſhall for ever be exalted
and ſet aloft, <hi>ſo ſhall the arme of fleſh</hi> (which is mans excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy)
<note n="c" place="margin">Jer. 17. 5. 6.</note> for ever be abaſed and kept under,<note place="margin">Eze. 30. 21. 22.</note> which is moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and well pleaſing unto faith, to have this glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64158:21"/>
change, ratified and confirmed unto, and in the Saints for ever,
that Gods glory may appeare and be made manifeſt in man,<note n="d" place="margin">Col. 1. 27.</note>
and the things of man may be hid and covered in God,<note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 32. 1. Zep. 2. 3.</note> hence
is that interchangeable, tranſlative and relative ſentence uttered
<hi>viz. The Lord ſaid unto my Lord,</hi> or as the word will beare, <hi>The
Lord ſaid in my Lord,</hi> that is the Kingly Lordſhip, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Chriſt ſpeakes, and uttereth it ſelfe, in the Prieſtly; and the
Prieſtly Lordſhip, &amp; authority of Chriſt, ſpeakes and utters it ſelf
in the Kingly; ſo that each of them hath prehemenence, and is
at the right hand of the other; for the Kingly Office and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſpeakes not, nor acts. but in, and by, the Lordſhip, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoty
of the Prieſthood; and the prieſtly office and dignity ſpeaks
not, nor acts, but in, and by, the Lordſhip, and authority of the
Kingdome, or of the Kingly office; for they are the right hand
of each other; by which, (and not otherwiſe) they mutually,
and interchangeably worke, and make themſelves manifeſt to be,
that which indeed they are, and ever will, for <hi>he lives for
ever to make interceſſion for the Saints.</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Heb: 7. 25.</note> This twofold Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

            <p>And this is that alſo that the men of our dayes, and unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in theſe times, as well as in the times that are paſt, cry out
againſt, and cannot endure it, as a doctrine moſt pernitious and

then is their heaven gone, <hi>their God is taken away from them</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Judg. 17. 5.</note>,
ſo that they cannot but cry out againſt ſuch doctrine<note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 12. 24</note>, and are

religion, muſt prove Antichriſtian; being they conſiſt of ſuch
things, which as the graſſe ſhall fade, wither, and come to
nought<note n="u" place="margin">Luke 16. 15.</note>: For the death of Chriſt, as it concernes the elect of
God, and the livelihood, operations, and exaltations of men in
the things of God, cannot poſſibly ſtand together, being in direct
oppoſition the one to the other. And hence it is, that our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
addeth theſe words:</p>
            <p>Vntill I have made thine enemies the foot ſtoole of thy feet.</p>
            <p>Who then are the onely enemies of that Princely dignity that
is in the Prieſthood of Jeſus Chriſt, by vertue of which
Prieſthood <hi>he entreth within the veile, into the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,

on high:</hi> So that none can take place of him<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 8. 1.</note> Now the utter and
ſole enemies of the dignity of this Royall Prieſthood of the Son
of God, are all manner of vertues, and excellencies whatſoever,
attainable by man<note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 1. 11. 12.</note>, that have not in them the riſe and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 1. 7. 15, 16, 17.</note>: For ſuch things beſeem not the Royalty
of this Prieſthood<note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note>, that bringeth nothing unto God for accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but what holdeth correſpondencie with him in, all
points<note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note>. The adverſaries therefore of this grace, are all things
brought into the worſhip of God, as things acceptable to God,
that are temporary, momentany, and of a fading condition<note n="f" place="margin">Col. 2. 21, 22, 23.</note>. In a
a word, what ever had beginning, or ſhall come to an end, is an
enemy to this Prieſthood<note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 7. 3.</note>. For it is not the humane Nature in
Chriſt, that is the acceptable thing or offering<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note>, but it is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſtate and condition of the unity of both Natures, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in one eternall Being, which no Man or Angell can ever find
out a time of their conjunction, and unity, no more then a time
of their diſ-uniting, and ſeparation can be found<note n="i" place="margin">Mark 10. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note>: For if a time
of conjunction can be found, without eternity, which hath no
beginning; then may a time of their diſ-junction be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
eternity that hath no end at all: For, Gods account and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
admits not ſo of time in the way of Chriſt, as to permit a
diſ-junction in that one pure, ſimple, ſingle, and eternall act, in
that workmanſhip of Chriſt. And therefore it is, that when the
myſtery of God is finiſhed, or perfected; that is, when the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of it is revealed and made known unto us, then is this gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in upon oath by the Angel, that <hi>Time ſhall be no more</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Rev. 10. 6. 7.</note>.
Then doe we reckon and account according to God, with whom
all times are preſent, becauſe he is the fulneſſe thereof in us.
For if he be <hi>all in all;</hi> then is he all in time, as well as any other
thing<note n="l" place="margin">Eph. 1. 23. 1 Cor. 15. 28.</note>. So that we muſt reckon, and keep the Records of the
Houſe of God, according to his account, and not according to the
ſhallow regiſter of a creature<note n="m" place="margin">Iſai. 55. 8. 9.</note>. With whom things are paſt,
that ſhall not return again, and alſo to come, that never yet were.
But the account of God is, <hi>Yeſterday and to day, and the ſame for

into the Houſe of God, as things acceptable to God, as places,
offices, gifts of learning in Arts, in Tongues; yea, the worlds
created gifts of grace, which it propoundeth to it ſelfe in point
of ſalvation, bearing it ſelfe in hand, that there are created gifts
of grace in a Chriſtian, which, are neither humane, nor yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;
ſo as to be properly the holy Spirit of God, which indeed
is to annihilate the Sonne of God, by deſtroying and bringing to
nought the grace of his Kingdome, in ſetting another form up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, <hi>then ever the Father of Lights did</hi>

all Chriſtianity<note n="ſ" place="margin">Heb. 8. 5.</note>. And to hold and teach ſomething to bee in
Chriſt, beyond or beſides the reality of God and Man, Humane
nature, and Divine, in one individuall ſubſiſtance, is no better
then to Idolize the Son of God, and to ſet him up, as a vain and

an Idoll is nothing in the world</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 4.</note>: or to make him to be <hi>Belial;</hi>
For there can be nothing but humane nature and divine in the
way of Chriſt, nor can there be any thing but humane nature and
ſin in the way of Antichriſt: So that to bring in a middle thing
in the way of Chriſt, is to bring in ſinne into that holy One of
God; and to bring in a middle thing in that way of Antichriſt, is
to make him to hold ſome correſpondency with the Son of God,
whereas, the Scripture concludes there is <hi>no agreement at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

Chriſt his true forme according to the holy Scriptures, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
an utter impoſſibility of finding ſuch kind of grace in him, as

away the body of the Sun from any part of the world, or from
any horiſon, and the beams and raies of it ceaſe to be in that place
and are not found at all, to give either heat or light; but the
place is in death and groſſe darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>Moreover if Chriſt ſhould bt have a ſparke, (as they call it)
beame or ray, or certain influence of the ſpirit, or divine nature
that being ſhed forth, or infuſed into the humane, and not the
reallity, and eſſentiality thereof; then he were not God, as

            <p>But to forme a grace in a Chriſtian, otherwiſe, or beſides, that

in oppoſition to the doctrine of all falſe and pernicious buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
That there is nothing in Chriſt Jeſus, that is created,
which is ſimply divine, nor is there any thing in him, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create,
which is ſimply humane: the unity and conjunction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64158:23"/>
of theſe twain in one, is <hi>that workmanſhip of God, created in

and abides firme and ſtable for ever: being that one eternall and
good grace of God; and alſo that one eternall and good worke
of God, which twain, can ſtand &amp; agree together for ever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
confounding, but gloriouſly harmonizing the one with the
other, ſo as faith or grace ſhall ever be made manifeſt, in this
good worke: and this good worke ſhall ever appeare in that faith
of Gods Elect; in whom ſo ever it is: (the deniall whereof doth
ſufficiently declare a man to be vain, &amp; empty of any thing that
is of God; for faith without works is dead:<note n="h" place="margin">Iam. 2. 20.</note>) and this one
worke, in which conſiſts all ſaith, or this one grace, in which
conſiſts all good workes, and opperations of God; Hath as many
diſtinct favoures or grace in it, as alſo workes and opperations:
as there are varieties of workes, and diſtinct favours, beauties,
and ſplendant glories; in that infinite and unſearchable word,
or mind of God manifeſted in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If this be the created gift, or theſe the created graces, which
the world intends, then let them diſcribe, and delineate the Lord
Jeſus; in whatſoever they ſpeak of, or in what reſpect they hold
him forth unto the ſouls of men; that is, in what term of relation
ſoever they propound him unto the world: let them do it ſo, that
the grace propoſed, may appear to be ſuch, as is ever accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with this great work creation and making; that is, <hi>with the
true ſpirituall and miſticall forming of the Sonne of God</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note> who is
made of a woman, made under the Law, and ſo under the curſe:

thoſe created graces, and only worke of God in Jeſus Chriſt;
which the world denies by teaching gifts, and graces of another
nature or kind.</p>
            <p>Yea, furthermore, thoſe that hold and teach a created gift;
that is of, and from the ſpirit; and yet not the ſpirit, neither
dare they affirme that it is humane, <hi>leſt the bed prove too ſhort,

divinity, a beame, or ray, of the nature divine, but not the divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
it ſelfe; (which they ſay is in the Saints) But yet wil affirme
by their traditions, that the reality of it is in Chriſt: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in the truth of the thing, they know not how it is in him:
but education in another way, would have brought them to have
ſpoken other things, eſpecially if preferment, had been intailed
or annexed thereunto; theſe are ſo faithfull in their doctrine, that
they muſt inevitably hold alſo, (and that by that undeniable law
&amp; rule of contraries, according to the way of the <hi>firſt Adam and
the ſecond:</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 5. 18, 19. 1 Cor. 15. 22.</note>) that all men, ſave only the firſt man that fell, have

the revelation and manifeſtation of ſuch an infinite, and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

as the firſt man was; and by this meanes, they deny the plain

wee are unto God, <hi>wee are it in him, and not in our ſelves,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the doctrine and profeſſion of the world in this point,
takes away and deſtroyes unto men, the very vertue, authoritie,

            <p>Yea, all things of this nature are the onely enemies of this
Royalty &amp; dignity that is in the Prieſthood of Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

not the honour of <hi>the right hand of God</hi> given unto him. For ſo far
as we lift up theſe as helps and furtherances in the Houſe of God;
as beautifull and comely in the Houſe of God, conſidered either
in our ſelves, or among a multitude; ſo farre we pull this Kingly
Prieſt from the Majeſty of his Throne. For <hi>he were not a Prieſt if
he were on the earth</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 8. 4.</note>: that is, in that way of the order of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron:</hi>
For no Prieſt ſuiting with the wiſdome of men, in their

they cannot be Prieſts, but by maintaining the workes and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64158:24"/>
of the fleſh; &amp; ſo they are enemies to this ſacred order and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance

carnalize the Coſpel, as to uphold the civill Magiſtrate to be the
defence of his Miniſtery in the Church, by the civill Sword, (as
the hypocrites ever doe; for <hi>they will take up no Tabernacle</hi> but
the Tabernacle of <hi>Moloch,</hi> and beare the Booth of <hi>the Kings</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Acts 7</note>) yet
he muſt of neceſſity maintain his own place, to be a condition

the reſt of his brethren; which is to maintaine the fleſh in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the dignity of one man above, or beyond another in the

               <note n="u" place="margin">Hebr. 2. 11. 14. &amp; v. 17. 18. Heb. 4. 15.</note>, we had never been ſaved: for to retain in, or to, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
any part of his excellency, in to retain and keep back all;
even as if we ſhould retain any part of our ſin that Chriſt tooke
not upon him, it were enough to lay the whole diſpleaſure of
God upon us for ever: for <hi>his ſeamleſſe Coat cannot be divided</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Joh. 19. 23, 24.</note>.

For when our Lord ſpeakes of the power and glory,

it to the Sonnes of mortall and vain man. So as, when

               <note n="r" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note>, and therefore muſt needs cleanſe them from it. They

and acceptation in ſuch acts (as our Saviour Chriſt
fore-tels he will) if it were not for this divination<note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 16. 2.</note>. And as
the perſecuters of <hi>Steven</hi> when they ſtoned him, prayed <hi>for the
acceptation of their ſouls,</hi> in ſo doing: For if the words be wel
ſcanned, it will prove to be their prayer made for themſelves,

would not lay it to their charge<note n="x" place="margin">Act. 7. 59</note>, which was anſwered by
God, and made effectuall in <hi>bringing Saul to become a Paul</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Act. 22. 20.</note>.
Nor could he adventure to transfer unto himſelf thoſe things
that are proper unto the Sonne of God, as to be a cleanſer of
the world from ſinne, were it not for this Art, wherein
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64158:29"/>
great and ſecret ſlight is uſed in this kind of cloſe conveyance.
So that when the Lord ſpeakes of the Croſſe of Chriſt in that
humbled and dejected eſtate of the word of God<note n="z" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 14. Iſa. 53. 2. to 8.</note>, they
well perceive there is great curioſity and skill therein, but
they cannot find it out to be in any place, but where there is
an eſtate and condition, for the preſent, incumbred with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe
and ſorrow; and therefore their Art is uſed to ſee how
to find out Religion in defending the oppreſſed, fatherleſſe,
and widow, relieving, comforting and lifting ſuch up, in
their outward eſtates and condition; and ſo by this carnall
apprehenſion judging the Kingdome of God to conſiſt in
theſe tranſitory things<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 14. 17. Iohn 18. 36.</note>; and hereby they alwayes keep Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
beneath, under, and below themſelves, and make
Chriſt to ſtand in need of their help and reliefe, though he be
ſpirituall, and themſelves never ſo carnall; and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be miniſtred unto by them: For he that gives to a Diſciple
muſt doe <hi>it in the name or authority of a Diſciple:</hi> that is, in the
place and office of a Learner, and then he ſhall not loſe the
reward, or (as the word is) the end of a Diſciple, which is to
be made a Teacher himſelfe, as our Lord ever doth, without
whom a Diſciple is nothing<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 10. 42.</note>, nor is the Lord without a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
            <p>And this requires the ſame curioſity and skill in Soo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying,
or elſe they could never make men to beleeve that they
were the defence, and protection; the reliefe and raiſers up of
the Sonne of God, as though he were held of death, till ſorry
man puts forth the hand for his help. In this conveyance, or
change, their eyes are dazzled alſo: for the Croſſe of Chriſt
conſiſts not, nor can it poſſibly have a Being, but in the
Crown<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 8 33, Heb. 2. 7. to 11.</note>, though they know it not. But thus their art, and,
carnall skill, is exerciſed in this poynt, in finding out multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of ſinnes (though they know nor one in truth) to be
plagued and puniſhed according to the way they underſtand
it, and perſons in miſery to be relieved and delivered onely in
the way of temporary reliefe and redemption, and by this
meanes keep the power and vertue of that reſurrection of the
Sonne of God, that it cannot be heard of, nor known in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64158:29"/>
world, by their metamorphoſing and changing it into tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
and momentany things, which hath indeed vanquiſhed,
overcome, and put an end to all theſe things; ſo as if ſo be it

            <p>Again, when the word of God ſpeakes of the power, place,
office, and operations of the Sonne of God, they perceive no
little art and cunning skill exerciſed thereabout; and therefore
they exerciſe all mans wit, and abilities with reſpect to the
word of God, without which they cannot bewitch to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<note n="f" place="margin">Exo. 7. 9, 10, 11, 12.</note>, no more then the Spirit of Chriſt can Evangelize to
ſalvation, but with reſpect to our frailties and infirmities:
Therefore they exerciſe their Art to fit and furniſh men with
abilities, and to adopt and adorne particular perſons with Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Offices, which are proper and peculiar onely to the
Sonne of God himſelfe. For they know not (neither will they

then to pull it down<note n="n" place="margin">Iſa. 2. 17.</note>, and to bring in, <hi>rather then make an

whilſt they make it their daily work to ſet him up according
to the fleſh. And if the ſpirituality of his Kingdome appeare
in any meaſure, they ſeek to demoliſh and overthrow the
ſame: for indeed otherwiſe their earthly &amp; carnall Prieſthood
cannot ſtand, no more <hi>then Dagon can ſtand before the Arke of
God</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">1 Sam. 5. 2, 3 4.</note>; for Chriſt <hi>were not a Prieſt, if he were on the earth;</hi> or
of any earthly conſticution: that is, <hi>after the Order of Aron</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 8. 4.</note>.
<hi>For all ſuch offer gifts according to the Law,</hi> that preſent unto
God that which ſhall have end, which is accounted by God <hi>a
carnall Commandment</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Col. 2. 21. 22. Heb. 7. 16.</note>; For there cannot be a Prieſthood
Elderſhip, or any Office in the Houſe of God, held to be more
exelent then all the reſt of the Saints are alſo inveſted into:
but it is earthly and carnall: and cannot agree with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Preiſthood of Chriſt. For to maintaine a greater
Dignity and place, in one man then in another, in the Houſe
of God, is nothing elſe but the Law of works, and walking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>carnall Commandment, according to which Chriſt
was never made a Preiſt</hi>
               <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 7. 13 14. 15. 16. 17.</note>: <hi>but in being Preiſt he aboliſheth
it</hi>
               <note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 7. 18.</note>.</p>
            <p>For if Chriſt had detained any office, or exelencie (what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever)
in himſelf<note n="y" place="margin">Eph. 1. 23.</note>, &amp; not conveyed the ſame unto, &amp; commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
the ſame with his brethren, our ſalvation had beene
made void, and overthrown. Eor if Chriſt detain in himſelf,
any excelencie or Office, in which the Saints Communicate
not with him; then muſt he of necesſity detain all, and they
communicate in none, elſe he cannot be the Son of God, and
ſo no Saviour of the world. For where any part of his office
or exelencie is found, there is all, or elſe he were not God;
nor could he be indeviduall, if any part of his excelencie were
communicated and not the whole<note n="z" place="margin">Iames 1. 5. 17. Iohn 1. 16.</note>. Therefore to officiate
men in the Houſe of God, in ſuch places as others of their
profeſſed brethren, whom they account off as of Saints, are not
capable of together with them; is earthly and carnall, ſeting
up the <hi>Leviticall Preiſthood of the Law,</hi> and not that of our
<hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> and cannot ſtand with, but utterly overthrows
the Preiſthood and Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>For he hath
obtained a more exelent Miniſtry, in as much as he is the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64158:30"/>
of a better Teſtament</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 7. 21, 22, 23, 24. Heb. 8. 6,</note> And in that Teſtament or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:

in that grace, having fellowſhip with him in his office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatourſhip
as well as in any other grace, &amp; may aſwel be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Mediatours in him. <hi>As Moſes was ſaid to be a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 3. 19.</note>, or as <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and the Judges of Iſrael were called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Neb. 7. 27. Heb. 4. 8. Oba. 21. ver.</note>, if we do not Idolize the word, which is the very

Jeſus to bow at it,</hi> as yeelding more reſpect unto that, then to
an other title given unto him<note n="d" place="margin">Phil. 2. 10.</note>. So it is in this, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of the word of God; For to Mediate is to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,
or to be an umpeere, or an arbitrator for ſo much the
word imports. That is, to Judge indifferently, &amp; without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiallity
of the things of two, &amp; ſo as to bring them to be one.
<hi>For a Mediatour is not a Mediatour of one, but God is one;</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 3. 20.</note>
that is, to Judge rightly of the things of God, and of the
things of man; truly knowing and pertaking of the mind of
the one, and of the other, which the men of this world count
blaſphemy; that the Saints ſhould communicate in ſuch an
office. Although it be true, that without participation and
communication herein, <hi>No prayer can be made unto God, that
can be fruitfull unto us, or acceptable unto him</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 8. 26. 22.</note>; Yet doth it
blaſpeme, ſtrick, or pierce, thorough their way of Mediatour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
who judge of all things according to the fleſh, that is
according to the will, and naturall underſtanding of a man,
<hi>that perceives not the things of God</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note>. And ſo indeed their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Teſtament, is confirmed unto them by the death of the
Teſtatour<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 9. 6. 17.</note>; For they ſeting up Chriſt according to the fleſh,
do thereby put him to death in the Spirit; <hi>And ſo are killers
and Crucifiers of the Lord of glory unto themſelves, puting
him to an open ſhame</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 6. 6.</note>, in the whole conrſe of their Miniſtry.
Without which, they cannot uphold their places, and offices,
unleſſe they maintain the firſt borne, <hi>in Cain, Eſau, and in
Egypt;</hi> namely the moſt exelent things that nature can bring
forth, preferring them before that vertue, and power of the
Son of God<note n="k" place="margin">Exo. 7. 11</note>. <hi>So that even as their Fathers did, ſo do they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this day</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Act. 7. 51.</note>. But out Mediatour gives man his proper right

matters of God, <hi>Yea concludes him in his beſt eſtate to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vanity, or emptineſſe</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 39. 5.</note>; and gives God his due alſo
who is ever <hi>Honourable, Wiſe, Powerfull, and full of goodneſſe
and truth</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Exod. 34. 6.</note>. So that wherever he appears, there is <hi>glory in the

<hi>was made in the image of God</hi>

Such is the way of Faith in that myſtery of God by Jeſus

who is not in any account or eſteeme with us, but in and

                  <note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 6. 18.</note>; That is, the Sonne of God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
man, <hi>The word was made fleſh</hi>
                  <note n="v" place="margin">Iohn 1. 14.</note>; <hi>Yea a man of ſorrowes
and acquainted with infirmitie</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Iſa. 50. 33.</note>; And in this God cannot
lye, counterfeit, or deſemble a thing that is not really ſo; as
the word imports (to counterfit writing) So that the realitie
of all the impreſſions, of mans naturall infirmity, were upon
him who is the Son of God, and theſe being the frailties and
infirmities of the Son of God, they muſt of neceſſity be
immutable and unchangeable; even as the vertue of his
death and ſuffering is. <hi>For in him is not a ſhaddow of change</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Iam. 1. 17. Mal. 3. 6.</note>,
and in him is mans nature which is the ſame, whereever, or
upon whomſoever, it is found ſimply conſidered in itſelf<note n="z" place="margin">Eph. 2. 3. John 5. 17. 20. 36.</note>:
And this fraile and weake nature, is alſo made and become
the Son of God; and hath upon it the true nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of God, by vertue of its unity with him in Chriſt<note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 4 7, 8, 9, 10.</note>.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64158:38"/>
And in this alſo God cannot lye, deſemble or counterfeit a
thing that is not really ſo; and therefore there is in it, all
that power, glory, vertue and excellency that is in the Lord
himſelf<note n="a" place="margin">Col. 2. 2, 3. 9.</note>; This alſo muſt of neceſſity be immutable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable:
So that the Sonne of God is become weake,
and fraile; yea dead to the counſel and devices of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
heart for ever,;<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 6. 6.</note> So alſo the Son of man is become
ſtrong and potent, yea alive unto God in the wiſdome and
Counſells of his Law and Spirit for ever<note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 2. 19. 20. Rom. 8. 2. 11.</note>.</p>
               <p>The Conſolation therefore of a Chriſtian ariſeth onely
from this Oath of interpoſition, for God hath interpoſed
this frailty, and infirmity of man, betwixt himſelfe and his
owne being in Chriſt; For he is not Jeſus the Sonne of
God, but through death; <hi>For by his death he ſaves.</hi> So that all
the Wiſdome, Power, and Goodneſſe of God, is onely made
manifeſt and exerciſeth it ſelfe through mans weakneſſe and
infirmity<note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 2 14</note>, and otherwiſe it hath not the uſe, exerciſe and
injoyment of it ſelf, no more then the Father injoyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
without his beloved Sonne<note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 9. 10.</note>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God hath interpoſed himſelfe betwixt ſorry
and weake man, and all thoſe frailties and imperfections
that naturally we are ſubjected unto. So that no miſery can
come unto us in point of ſalvation, and our comfort and
Faith in God, but it firſt encounters with God himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it can take hold of him that is in Chriſt; And what
impoſſibility there is, to overcome and vanquiſh the Sonne
of God the Almighty, <hi>yea God bleſſed for ever</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Pro. 8. 21, to 31.</note>; the ſame
impoſſibility there is, that a Chriſtian ſhould be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
or overcome; of ſuch ſecurity and ſafety, is this Oath
of interpoſition, in the ordination of our Kingly Prieſt;
For as the frailties and infirmities of man, through that
wonderfull and unſpeakable Wiſdome of God in Chriſt,
ſerve for no other end, nor are of other uſe but to give
Being, unto the humiliation and deſcenſion of the Sonne of
God in us<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 9. 5. Pſalm 119. 122.</note>, ſo alſo his power and dignity, is of no other
uſe in this ſalvation and Prieſthood, but to give Being unto
the Reſurrection, and Aſſention of the Son of man in him<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 8. 3. 4.</note>.
<note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 13. Epheſ. 4. 8. 10.</note>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:64158:38"/>
for Chriſt can neither deſcend, nor aſcend, as hee is ſimply
God; any poſſibility of that, in either reſpect, may not bee
admitted, in any caſe: For, as he is God, he can neither be
lower, nor higher, then God; for ſo he is not; Nor can he
be ſubject to motion, mutation, or change,<note n="i" place="margin">Mal. 3. 6.</note>. But his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
is a motion, or change, from <hi>height to depth,</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 8, 9.</note>. From <hi>bleſſedneſſe, to a curſe</hi> in the abſtract.<note n="l" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note>, And ſo
God becomes low in us, or in our nature,<note n="m" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 8.</note>, His reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or aſcenſion, is a change or motion, alſo, from the
<hi>depths into the heights,</hi> from <hi>being a curſ, to become the bleſſed,</hi>
yea, the Son of the living God,<note n="n" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 9, 10. Luke 1. 35.</note>, And ſo we, or our nature.
is exalted or lifted up, in the power and dignity of the
Word of God, <hi>which made all things in the beginning, and
without it is nothing made</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Iohn 1. 1, 2, 3.</note>. Indeed nothing in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
&amp; Prieſthood takes its true forme, or retaines its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aright, but only as it hath its riſe, forme, vertue, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and glory, in this unity, and communication of, and
between God and Man, in the way of Jeſus Chriſt<note n="p" place="margin">Iohn 1. 4, 5. Pſalm. 139. 15, 16.</note>. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>in him only doe all things conſiſt,</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Col. 1. 17. Col. 1. 16 20.</note> 
                  <hi>are reconciled, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monized,
and become one, and that one is become all thingsr</hi>. So
that without faith in him, wee have not the forme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of things, but a meere Shadow, and rude heape in

gives forme to all things in this Kingdome, is but a riddle
unto us, (if we be unbeleevers) in whatſoever it expreſſeth
<note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 13. 34, 35.</note>, So alſo the work of God, receiving forme and being by

with every winde of doctrine, or operation in the world,
<note n="w" place="margin">Iam. 1. 6, 7, 8.</note>. For, the Son of God cannot become one <hi>of no reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
but in our nature<note n="x" place="margin">Phil. 2. 6, 7,</note>, that is, (as the word ſignifies)
vaine, empty, nothing; he cannot be debaſed and annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64158:39"/>
but in us, nor can our nature be dignified, filled with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<hi>to do all things,</hi> but in the Word of God<note n="y" place="margin">Phil. 4. 12. 13.</note>, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man <hi>is Immutable,</hi> in that it is ever debaſed, and

Word of God is <hi>Immutable,</hi> in that it is for ever exalted in
the weakneſſe and infirmity of Man,<note n="z" place="margin">Cor. 12. 9. 10.</note>, So that without
the weakneſſe and infirmity of man, the Word of God is
not, that being the humiliation of Jeſus Chriſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the power and authority of God, the nature of man is
not; that being the lifting up, and exaltation of the ſame
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ignorance therefore of this Oath of <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi>
ſtanding in theſe <hi>two immutable things, wherein it is
impoſſible for God to lye,</hi> is the grand diſcouragement, and
diſcomfort of all the world.</p>
               <p>For it conſiſts of the Kingdome and Prieſthood of Jeſus
Chriſt, his exaltation and humiliation, his ſtrength, and his
weakneſſe, his immortality, and his mortality, his life, and
his death, his riches, and his poverty, his ſupereminencie,

joy, peace, and quiet of all that beleeve.</p>
               <p>For ſo the Oath of God is made one, though it conſiſts of

and bind over in the conſcience of man, as it hath in

is, they holds correſpondencie in all points, elſe it
could not be the humiliation of the Son of God, for that
cannot admit of any bounds or limitation whatſoever; For
Chriſt as he is Man, is exalted through his unity with the
Word of God, above the ſtate and condition of any created
nature whatſoever<note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 9. 5.</note>. So is the Word, or that Son of God
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Iohn 1. 14. Heb. 1. 5.</note>, being made fleſh, vilified and abaſed below the ſtate &amp;
condition of any thing that is ſimply a creature whatſoever,
for all Creatures are by nature good<note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 1. 31,</note>, as the work of that
one, onely, and good God.</p>
               <p>Now the work of God cannot be perfected but in man,
who is an abridgement, or an epittomy of all the Creatures,
who are therefore ſaid to be good in the Creation, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or bringing forth of them being ſaid to be ſo, as they
had refrence unto man,<note n="v" place="margin">Gen. 2. 18. Pſal. 8. 6, 7, 8.</note> Being made for his uſe, benefit,

of them all: For in him onely is the Worke of God
perfect; without which, no reſt nor Sabbath can be found,

in man alone.</p>
               <p>And therefore the humiliation of Chriſt muſt of neceſſity
have its being in man, or rather the anihiliation of the Son

               <p>Now the work of God only in the Creation of Man, is an
infinite work; which in any other, or in all other Creatures
it cannot be; for however they be the worke of an infinite
God, yet the work is but a Creature, and therefore finit
for a Creature, ſimply conſidered, is a finit thing; but Man
was not, nor had his being for a moment, but in the Image
of God<note n="x" place="margin">Gen. 1. 26, 27.</note>; <hi>For in that Image be was created,</hi> and had his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

namely, the Creation, frame, and being of Man, is onely an

that Image, Wiſdome, or Word of God (which is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and fulneſſe of all divine and heavenly excellencies)
made of, or in the duſt or ſlime of the Earth: So that it is
not the proper work of God, looked upon in man, but as it
conſiſts of the unity of the Creator, and the Creature, being
become one,<note n="c" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 14. 15, 16 Iohn 17. 21, 22.</note>: So that this work hath in it, not only that

make man in our own Image,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> which is not a Conſultation of

So that <hi>Adam</hi> in this reſpect, <hi>is truly called the Son of God</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 3. 38.</note>,
not only by Creation (as men think) but by Adoption alſo,
yea and the Son of God by nature; For he is the Sonne of
God by nature, becauſe the Image of God which is the
Wiſdom of God, and God himſelf, are of the ſame nature,
and ſo is he the Son of God by nature.</p>
               <p>He is alſo a Son by Adoption, or taken out of the houſe of
a ſtranger, for as he is earth, <hi>and ſo bears the Image of the
earthly</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor, 1. 5.</note>, he is a ſtranger, and forreyner from that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
glory, and excelency that is in God, and ſo is he
the Sonne of God by Adoption. And he is alſo a Sonne by
Creation, and that is, the making and framing of theſe two
together in one glorious work; which is indeed the <hi>New
Creature,</hi> or the <hi>Creation of God</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Rev. 3. 14.</note>, and ſo is he the

for as the operation of our hearts work for the interpoſing

               <p>Now the breach of this Oath, Bond, Covenant, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,

that, and that onely gives length, and latitude, to the death,

               <p>Now whereas we ſay, that God is a party in this bond, it
is ſo to be underſtood, as a party in the Oath, or Contract,
but no party in the breach; for the breach and forfeiture,
ariſeth onely from man, and is his ſole and proper worke;

worke or Covenant, that, and that onely, can ſufficiently
extend, the death and humiliation of Jeſus Chriſt, to be

Therefore we muſt either deny the death, and humiliation

Contract, or Oath, in point of Creation, by the ſin of

<hi>that Sea and Land whereupon this Angell ſtandeth,</hi> of ſuch

into one point of time, into a moment and twinkling of an

God, that it compoſeth it ſelfe into that, which is as a
moment, or twinkling of an eye: For ſuch is man, whoſe
breath is in his Noſtrils; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> for hee is not a man according to
Gods workmanſhip, but as he ſuſtaines the image of God,
and lives the life of the Son of God, which he cannot preſerve
himſelfe in, no not for a momennt of time; but it wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon God to doe it<note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 39, 5 Pſal. 94. 11. Pſal. 49 12. Job. 7. 6.</note>, no more then the Sonne of God
can be held of death, or be a ſinner for a moment of time. The
ſhortneſſe of mans life therefore is ſuch, as is the time he can
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64158:46"/>
preſerve himſelf in that life and image wherein he was made,
which is no longer then the Sonne of God can permit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be a ſinner, which is not for a moment, for <hi>he knew no
ſinne</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">2 Cor, 5. 21.</note>. The change then of the Sonne of God, from ſinne
unto righteouſneſſe, and the change of the ſonne of perdition
from righteouſneſſe unto ſinne, are of like time and eternity,
that is, in the twinkling of an eye, it is done; and for eternity
it abides and remaines: for the Sonne of God is made ſinne,
but changed into righteouſneſſe in the twinkling of an eye;
and the ſonne of perdition is made righteous, but changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſinne in a moment, even in the twinkling of an eye: and
we know that the time of the twinkling of an eye is ſuch, as
the eye never loſeth its object. So is the time of the Sonne of
God being made ſinne, and death, that hee never loſeth the
fight-and being of righteouſneſſe and life; and the time of the
ſonne of perdition being made righteouſneſſe, is ſuch, as hee
never loſeth the ſight, and being of that man of ſin,
and death, into ſuch a narrow poynt, (in the power of ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
doth this Key bring that immenſe and unfadomed pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and glory of God into, in that way of Chriſt: for of ſuch
nature as this opening and ſhutting, are all the actions of the
Sonne of God; for in him eternity becomes a moment of
time: for of further extent then a moment of time, the life
and glory of man cannot be extended, and a poynt of time is
opened into eternity; and into a narower compaſſe then that,
none can abridge nor contract the Sonne of God<note n="y" place="margin">Iſai. 9. 6. John 1. 1. 23. Joh. 8. 53. Prov. 8. 22. to 31.</note>. So that
as they are actions performed in a creature, they are momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,
tranſient, and paſſe away in the twinkling of an eye:
But as they have their rice, originall and fountain in the word
of God, they are of an eternall vertue, weight and value, and
remain and abide for ever. So, that however <hi>he tabernacles in

the firſt and the laſt into one preſent being, which is
the neereſt that poſſibly can be<note n="e" place="margin">Iſai. 44. 6 Iſai. 41. 4.</note>. For this wonderfull and
ſpeedy change is made in the ſound of the laſt Trumpet<note n="f" place="margin">Rev. 1. 17. 18.</note>,
which cannot be known but by the firſt that ever ſounded or
uttered it ſelfe, which is an opening unto the utmoſt diſtance:
For it is the manner of Gods explicating and opening of his
Word and Workes, to declare the laſt things from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or from the firſt, or the leaſt things from the chiefeſt,
and things of old, <hi>or the moſt ancient and honourable</hi> from
<hi>things that are not yet done,</hi> or in themſelves have not any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The firſt Trumpet then that ever ſounded as an Alarum of
this change, was this, <hi>And hee breathed into his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils
the breath of lives;</hi> for ſo the word is plurall, <hi>and
man became a living ſoule,</hi> or ſoulie ſoule; or animall ſoule or
life, that is the Word, Spirit, Breath, Wiſedome, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God, became ſuch a thing or nature, that could not
ſupport it ſelfe, as of, or by it ſelfe, in that image, breath, or
life given unto it, no not for a moment, ſo that if our nature
be not animated, quickned, and revived every moment, it is
not poſſible to live that life or breath, which at the firſt was
given unto it. Hence ariſeth that ſudden change in the
twinkling of an eye, both in the way of the ſonne of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and alſo in the way of the Sonne of God. For God and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64158:47"/>
Man being one, not by any change of nature, or property,
that the nature of God becomes the nature of Man, or the
nature of man is become the nature of God; nor is the nature
of man infinite, omnipotent, or omniſcient, or the like, no
more then the nature of God can be finit, impotent, or defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
in the leaſt, for then he were not God<note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 3. 14 15.</note>. But there is
a unity of the two natures in this wonderfull workmanſhip
of Man: ſo that the Image of God is not, but with reſpect
to the duſt, or our nature; nor is the duſt, or our nature (in
this work) but with reſpect to the image, breath, or life, and
ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore, it is ſaid of thoſe two (<hi>Let Vs make Man</hi>)<note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note>,
even as it is ſaid of the Man and the Woman, in the Image of
God created hee (<hi>Him</hi>) ſingularly, <hi>Male and Female,
created he (Them</hi>) expreſſing it in the plurall number, <hi>and
called their name Adam,</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 5. 2.</note>, they have both one name in that
place given unto them, to declare their unity, and are alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

ſo are theſe two natures in this wonderfull Compoſition of
God and Man, compriſed under this Name, <hi>Adam, or the
Sonne of God,</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 3. 38</note>. So that if wee cannot proceed in the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie

and finde all Sons in one Sonſhip: yea, lengthen it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

                  <note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 5: 12, 13 14.</note>, for without Adam Jeſus is not, for hee ſaves by
his death,<note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 2. 14 Heb, 9. 22.</note>, but no death can be found, for the Son of God,

for the wiſdome of God knowes how to bring glory out of
ſhame, and unity out of that vaſt diſtance, that is (in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
betweene God and Man, which is no leſſe then ſinne
and righteouſneſſe, each in the abſtract; even as the Serpent

and that vaſt diſtance between God and Man (which ſinne

life of Man,<note place="margin">Acts. 17. 25, 26, 27, 28.</note> is the life of the Son of God,<note n="s" place="margin">Gal. 2. 20. Col. 3. 3, 4.</note>, to live after the

in death.<note n="y" place="margin">1 Cor, 15. 29</note>. If that death ſhould not be the reſurrection,
from the dead; then ſhould the life of the Sonne of God be
extinct for ſome time; for now is Chriſt dead, and riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8. 33 34. Revel. 2. 8.</note> and if theſe two ſhould not be in one act, and point

both natures; therefore the death is the reſurrection, of
ſuch ſcope is that place of the Apoſtle; and of ſuch force
the argument there uſed: however the words differ in the
tranſlation, for more eaſe in reading: therefore he addes, <hi>and
wherefore are we in jeopardy every houre,</hi> or every moment, as
the word ſignifies,<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 30.</note>, that is, why do you think (for I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale

all dangers, perills, loſſes; yea, and to death every moment,
and not evade, and wave thoſe things, as the men of the
world doe, if we found not ſafety ſtrength, and ſtability in
them: yea, if this death were not life it ſelf unto us: For, by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64158:50"/>
how much the more our jeopardies are doubled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled,
even ſo is our life augmented or multiplyed in the

this the Apoſtle confirmes by that great affirmation, or aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration,
<hi>proteſt by your rejoycing which I have in Chriſt Ieſus
our Lord, I dye daily</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 31</note>, which affirmation hath the forme
of an oath, in declaring, that as death hath the reſurrection
in it, or is the reſurrection it ſelf; even ſo alſo, the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the dominion or Lordſhip of Chriſt hath death in it, or
is death it ſelf, and is in ſubſtance, this oath of interpoſition
proclaimed in the name of the Lord, ſhewing the ſame neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
and infallibillity of the unity and one-neſſe of the Saints
of God in Chriſt, in reſpect of every particular Saint, (or

<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 18. 1 Iohn 3 9. 1 Iohn 2. 29. Iames 1. 18.</note> as it doth of the unity of that common nature, or condition
of man with the word of God, whereof by nature they are
all alike partakers: for the Word of God cannot unite
it ſelfe to a part of mans nature or condition, whereinto
man is plunged, no more then our nature in Chriſt can bee
united unto a part of the word, or a part of the condition and
ſtate of the Sonne of God, and not to the whole; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
were to divide Chriſt. For the humiliation of the Sonne
of God is of an infinite extent, &amp; therefore may not, nor can be
abridged in point of deſcenſion of any miſery or wretchednes,
the nature of man (in the utmoſt extent) was ever ſubjected
unto.</p>

The word in our tranſlation rendred <hi>feare,</hi> ſignifies ſuch a fear
<hi>as is to utter deſpaire,</hi> which indeed is the very ſtate of the

no more then the womb of a ſilly virgin, in time;

that are ſeparated, and ſtand upon termes of diſcord for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and yet it is as impoſſible that God ſhould be any
cauſe of this emnity and wrath, as a Fountaine, from

height of excellency that ever was, and wee look not upon
the works of God with a ſpirituall eye, or light, no further

know <hi>how all things are made, reconciled together, and brought

               <p>Therefore utterly impoſſible, that God ſhould be wrath
with, or hate ſo glorious a worke, ſo that however it is
true, and undenyable, that God is a party in this breach,

the nullity of the work; for God is the maker of all

               <p>Therefore how ever God is a party in the breach, yet
the whole diſolving of the Contract, in gendring of wrath

after, and judging of the things of God, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate,

And wheras in any thing; men have learned by the tradition
of their Fathers, things that the wiſdome of a creature rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
not; as, the incarnation of the Sonne of God, that he
that is God ſhould be made a creature; or that the creature
ſhould be made that which is God; or that one ſhould bee

which is not in himſelfe, but in another; or that the ſoule of
man is immortall; whereas there can be no more immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
then there is infinite; for the creature can as well bee
infinite as immortall. When men ſeem to go into theſe or the

that they give being unto Chriſtianity, they walk, or rather
wander and groap in the dark, ſpeaking from Tradition, as
they have taken it at the ſecond hand from others (which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

is there is nothing in the Church which is not ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall

cannot have a being, we ſpeak what we know,<note n="t" place="margin">2 Tim. 2 7 Ioh. 4. 21, 22 23, 24. 2 King. 17. 29.</note>, For
<hi>if we have learned the truth as it is in Ieſus,</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Epheſ. 4 21</note>, then we

               <p>For take away any thing that is in Chriſt, and you

from him, and he is no Chriſt: for then his humanity
is denyed.</p>
               <p>Take from him, his incomprehenſibleneſſe, and his
not being contained in any place, and then wee deny
him to be GOD, and ſo to bee the Saviour of the
world.</p>
               <p>Take away Eternity from Him, and Chriſt is made
of none effect.</p>
               <p>Take away His being in time, and wee diſanull His
coming in our nature, which cannot but be in time.</p>
               <p>Even ſo it is in regard of a true Church, as it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of a true Chriſt: for the ſame tearme or title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the one, is alſo given to the other,<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12.</note>.</p>
               <p>So that as there are many falſe Chriſts,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 24. 5. Mat, 24. 24 22. Marke 13. 22, 23.</note>, ſo alſo
there are many falſe Churches; and if wee take away
any thing from Chriſt, that is in him, wee propound a
falſe Chriſt unto the world.</p>
               <p>So alſo, if we take away from the Church, any thing
that is to be ſound in the Church, we propound a falſe
Church; yea, <hi>ſet up the Synagogue of Sathan in the
world,</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Rev. 2. 9. Revel. 3. 9.</note>.</p>
               <p>And as for that diſtinction, of being, &amp; well-being
of a Church as if the Church might have a being &amp; yet
want a well-being it is meerly deviſed, and humane in
the things of God, and no arguing according to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>For as the Sonne of God never had being without
well being alſo; for the humane nature never had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but in the divine: So the Church of God never
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64158:58"/>
hath being, without a well-being: For what it is in
any reſpect whatſoever, it is that in Chriſt, and Chriſt
cannot be divided; <hi>for of his fulneſſe we all receive, and
grace for grace,</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Col. 1. 19. Col. 2. 9. compared with Iohn 1. 16.</note>.</p>
               <p>So that if we know not how to give the woman her
due time, of being in the wilderneſſe, we know not the
Chruch of Chriſt; for it concernes her being and her
well-being alſo.</p>
               <p>Yea, this circumſtance of time is fundamentall; for
we know not how the Church hath her being without
it; that is, without that her being in the wilderneſſe:
<hi>for the womans flight into the wilderneſſe,</hi> inſtructs us in
the weak fraile, and brittle veſſell of our earthly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>and the Man-child caught up to GOD, and His
Throne,</hi> to rule the Nations,<note n="e" place="margin">Rev. 12. 5, 6.</note>, inſtructs us in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and authority of the Word of God; in ſuch ſort, as
the Man is not without the Woman; nor the Woman
without the Man in the Lord,<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 11.</note>; no more then the
divine nature is without the humane, or humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without the divine in that way of Jeſus Chriſt:
<hi>So that in the Womans appearing in Heaven, having in
her a Man-child,</hi> is taught the deſcenſion of the word
in our nature, and the aſcenſion of our nature in the
Word of God, even as it was taught, in the making of
the firſt man, <hi>having the woman taken out of him:</hi> the
one declaring the way of death, and ſubjection of our
nature unto ſinne, when the woman is brought forth
and prevailes with her arguments, and reaſonings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to humane frailty, in thoſe ſuggeſtions of the
Serpent, or wiſdome of the fleſh<note n="g" place="margin">Gen, 3. 4, 5, 6.</note>: And the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
the aſcenſion of our nature, when the Man is
brought forth of the Woman, and taken up into the
Throne to rule over all the wayes, and arguments of
the Heathen, or deviſes ſuggeſted by the fleſh,<note n="h" place="margin">Rev. 12. 5. Mat. 4. 10. 11.</note>.</p>
               <p>So then the Woman in the Wilderneſſe, is the Word
of God deſcended into our nature, that wayleſſe, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64158:59"/>
vaſt Wilderneſſe utterly void, waſt and deſtitute, of the
foot ſteps of God; through the panges paines and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
whereof, it brings forth it ſelf,<note n="i" place="margin">Rev. 12. 2.</note>, in that glorious
deſcenſion and humiliation of the Son of God, and the
Man child caught up to God, and to his Throne,<note n="k" place="margin">Rev. 12. 5.</note>, is
our nature taken up into the Unity of that Word of
God, ruling the Nations, in, and by the authority of
God, in whoſe ſeat or throne it is ſet,<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note>. So that if wee
look into the Wilderneſſe, there is Chriſt compleat in
his humiliation; and if wee look into Heaven, there is
Chriſt compleat in his exaltation: and theſe two can
never be the one, without the other; for they are one
as Chriſt is one. Hear, O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Lord thy God is
one Lord,<note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 4. 6</note>.</p>
               <p>The Woman then is in the Wilderneſſe for a time;
that is, Eternity is become that which is contained in
a point, or period of time: and one period, or point of
time, is become that which is eternall: Eternity is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
time, and time is become eternity, in that act of
the creation, or incarnation of the Word of God, and
without communication with time in this reſpect, thus
extended, and thus abridged, the Church of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſubſiſt, nor have a being.</p>
               <p>She is alſo ſaid to be there for <hi>times,</hi> in the plurall
number; for it is multiplyed into the time of death,
and the time of life, the time of deſcenſion, &amp; the time
of aſcenſion: yea into a time of wrath, and a time of
reconciliation and peace.</p>
               <p>For there was ever a time of Antichriſt, for he comes
out of the bottomleſſe pit,<note n="n" place="margin">Rev. 9. 23 Rev. 11. 7. Rev. 17. 7.</note>; in which condition and
ſtate Chriſt hath no time at all, &amp; there was ever a time
of Chriſt alſo, who comes out of the boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 3. 17 Col. 1. 13. 2 Pet. 1. 16, 17. Iohn 1. 18.</note>, in which ſtate and condition, Antichriſt hath no
time at all; therefore a plurality of times: yea, Chriſt
himſelfe never lived unto the fleſh, and he ever lives
unto the ſpirit, which is a two fold time, ever, &amp; never,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64158:59"/>
and without the communication of theſe times, the
Church of God can have no being.</p>
               <p>Again ſhe is in the wilderneſſe for <hi>half a time, or for
the diviſion of times</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> hath it,<note n="p" place="margin">Dan. 7. 25</note>,
whence our Apoſtle brings it, that is, in that very
point and moment of time, of the incarnation, or of
making the word fleſh<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn. 1. 14.</note> is divided into a time of life,
and a time of death; in ſuch ſort, as the one is not, nor
can it be, ſo much as the twinkling of an eye, before
or after the other: no more then God to become Man
can be ſooner or later, then Man becomes the Sonne of
God: and ſo is the very moment, or point of time,
divided in ſuch ſort, that it could never be ſaid: Now
this is, and the other is not yet; no, not with the quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
eye, that ever caſt it ſelfe upon an object. Nay this
diviſion of time is ſuch a parting halfing, or dividing
of it that it holds correſpondency and proportion, both
in reſpect of the time of life, as alſo in the time of
death in all points: for they ſtand in direct oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and counterpoiſe each other, in as much as the Son
of God, to dye the death of Man; and the Son of Man
to live the life of God, are of equall extent; yea, of the
ſame difficulty and eaſe, poſſibility &amp; impoſſibility; the
one as the other, and ſo are all other things in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion:
for theſe are the two great wings given unto
the woman, wherewith ſhe takes her flight,<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 12. 14.</note> which
are not according to nature (as in the things trimly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
unto: namely the wings of a Foule) in their
firſt inſtitution and ordination, if they hold not preſize
proportion in all reſpects; ſo that her deſcenſion into
the wilderneſſe, is her mounting aloft unto Heaven, as
an Eagle doth, and her mounting up to Heaven, is her
deſcenſion into the wilderneſſe after the prey, as an
Eagle doth; yea, her deſcenſion is her aſcenſion, &amp; her
aſcenſion is her deſcenſion.</p>
               <p>For ſhe appeares in heaven (as the Man did firſt in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64158:60"/>
the Garden) &amp; from thence the Son flyes in her womb
into the wilderneſſe, as an Eagle after the prey, to
ſwallow up death in victory, &amp; the Son being <hi>brought
forth by her in the Wilderneſſe, in him ſhe is caught up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Throne of God, to rule over the Nations,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 12. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and to
overcome the Divell and his Angels,</hi> even as the woman
was made in the man at the firſt Creation, Ruler, and
Lord, over all the Workes of Gods hand,<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 1. 27, 28.</note>. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
then, that the woman is in a ſolitary, wayleſſe,
uncomely, and uncomfortable condition in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
(as men conceive) ſo long as the humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Son of God, in our nature, and the exaltation
of our nature, in being united with the word, can bee
devided and ſeparated, and not a jot longer, which is
impoſſible to find, know, underſtand, or apprehend, the
one without the other, in the truth or operation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
no not for a moment of time: onely mens carnall

knowing the truth, certainty, and ſubſiſtance of that

that make a time of the Womans being in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,

               <p>A time alſo, of the calling of the Jewes, &amp;c. before
the Church of GOD can attaine its peace, beauty,
power, authority, excellencie, and ornaments in this
World.</p>
               <p>They alſo make a time betweene the humiliation

it is to preſerve his own life for the preſent, and thereby

acceptation, and truth of interpretation, in that it
is ſubject unto corruption, not able to ſuſtaine it ſelfe; there
is another weakneſſe, in that it is impotent, not able to
conceive of, or to performe the things of God<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note>.</p>
               <p>Another weakneſſe of diſhonour becauſe that in it is not

               <p>Another weakneſſe, in that it is naturall, carnall, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall,
becauſe the very bent, end, and ſcope of all the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

and of a fadeing and vaniſhing nature and condition.</p>
               <p>And ſo are the wayes and motions of the fleſh multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into that vaſt and illimited gulfe, of mans infirmities

               <p>Therefore it is ſaid, as was noted before, <hi>that man

of things on the earth which God made at the firſt)
to increaſe the kindes of them, onely the influence of the

<hi>there is a body celeſtiall</hi> which is abſolute and compleate,
that no addition can be admitted of in it, no more then the
motion, and operation of things here below, can either
add or deminiſh, thoſe heavenly bodies that are above,
onely in their changes operations, and generations, they
ſhew forth and make manifeſt the ſeverall vertues and
powers which are in thoſe heavenly bodies, yet
each hath his propper and diſtinct glory; for the one is the

which nothing can be added or deminiſhed, and the other
is the way and glory of his reſurrection and exaltation,
which admits not of a jot leſſe impoſſibility of any additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

multiplyed in the one reſpect, ſo alſo are the glories, and
perfections multiplyed in the other reſpect.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>there is one Glory of the Sonne, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

that is, according to the various infirmity of the body

               <p>The Lord hath wonderfully proportioned thoſe infinit

               <p>Without the knowledge of which no direction can in

                  <note n="n" place="margin">Acts 15. 16.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The worke therefore neglected, or unskilfully handled,
Chriſt is not come unto us,</hi> this body therefore, graine,
or ſeede of Immortality; is ſowne in Corruption, but it riſeth
in Incorruption<note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 23. Eſa. 61. 3. 4.</note>; it is ſowne in diſhonour, it is raiſed in
glory; it is ſowne inweakneſſe, but it is raiſed in power; it is
ſowne a naturall body, it riſeth a ſpirituall body; <hi>ſo
that without the unity of two; there can be no reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>
for the wheate Corne muſt dye, before it riſe to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplycation;
ſo that however bare Graine be ſowne; <hi>it riſeth

Graine.<note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 36, 37, 38.</note>.</p>
               <p>So that the word of God ſowne in our nature; if in

become one body, or ſubſiſtance, they conſiſt in one,
even as the ſeede ſowne in the earth, and the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

               <p>For as that one graine multiplies it ſelfe in the earth, in

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Marke 4. 28.</note>, elſe it were impoſſible, that ſo many ſhould

condition of our nature, it is raiſed in glory, for diſhonour,
and honour, become one body, the one is the deſcention of

               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:64158:65"/>
The deſcenſion of the divine nature, is into our eſtate

               <p>The exaltation of the humane nature, is into the ſtate,
condition, and authority of the word,<note n="r" place="margin">Phil. 2, 8, 9, 10. Iohn 5. 26, 27. Ioh. 17. 2.</note>, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

impoſſible as it is, for that pure and honorable Word, or
Son of the Father, to be mortall or diſhonorable in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
but ſolely and wholly in us, hee is made mortall
and diſhonourable.</p>
               <p>So alſo it is impoſſible that wee ſhould be immortall
or glorious in our ſelves, but ſolely and wholly in that
word, we are made immortall and glorious.</p>
               <p>So that his becomming mortall, and ſubject to death,
is our becomming immortall, and living for ever; or
elſe the <hi>ſeed of life is not ſowne in death, the Son of GOD
hath not ſuffered and dyed for our ſins;</hi> and his being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable,
and being debaſed, is our becomming ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
and being exalted; <hi>or elſe the Sonne of Man is
not exalted and riſen again, wee are yet in our ſins and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 17 Xev. 16. 15.</note>.</p>
               <p>So that Chriſt his humiliation, is not without our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation;
nor is our exaltation without his humiliation,
for they are one.</p>
               <p>So that if we ſeparate or divide theſe, we make a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Jeſus Chriſt: for the Word cannot be lowern
it ſelf, then naturally it is in it ſelf, for then it ſhould ceaſe
to be GOD, in whom is not ſo much as a ſhaddow of
change or alteration,<note n="t" place="margin">Iames 1. 17</note>.</p>
               <p>So that his humiliation; as alſo his exaltation, muſt
both be in us,<note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 8. 4. 2 Cor. 1. 5.</note>.</p>
               <p>And therefore to deny either of theſe in our ſelves, is
to deny <hi>that Chriſt is dead; yea, rather that he is riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
from the dead,</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 8. 34</note>. For if we deny theſe things in the

For every man ſuſtains the whole and compleat nature

               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:64158:66"/>
Therefore it is, <hi>that by nature we are all alike,</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 1, 2, 3.</note>. And
thence it is, that as the ſeed of the Virgin became one

the whole nature, and diſpoſition, ſtate or condition of
Mankind, without any limitation or reſtrict on at all,<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 2. 9. Rom. 5. 19, 20, 21.</note>
elſe had not his humiliation beene abſolute and perfect,
ſuch as becomes, and is compatible to the Son of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite

death and reſurrection on of our Lord Ieſus Christ,</hi> and aſcribe
unto man no higher, nor better eſtate and condition,
than that of a bruit Beaſt upon the face of the Earth:
For Chriſt did become mortall, as the ſoule of Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
immortal; and the one is as poſſible, eyther to be
ſo, or to be known to be ſo, as is the other.</p>
               <p>For as the Word cannot be mortall but only in us: ſo
we cannot be immortall, but only in it.</p>
               <p>So that if the eternall Word, the Sonne of God, may
ceaſe to dye unto the fleſh (unto which he cannot dye,
unleſſe he continue, and abide to be one with it) then
may the ſonne of ſorry man ceaſe to live to the ſpirit;
which he cannot doe, unleſſe he ceaſe to be one with it;
and to affirme the one or the other, is to make voyd that
unity that is in Chriſt; and to diſanull that Covenant
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64158:66"/>
and Contract between God and Man, <hi>and make of none
effect that oath of interpoſition, whereby our High Prieſt is
inſtalled into his Office; and by vertue whereof he is made,
a miniſter of the Sanctuary,</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 7. 21 Heb. 8. 1, 2.</note>, <hi>and ever liveth to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion

               </p>
               <p>Yea, if that eternall word ſhould ceaſe to be, that
which is in time, ſo much as for a moment (which it
muſt doe, if the ſoule dye with the body, at ſuch time as
the body of Chriſt lay dead in the grave) then muſt the
Sonne of God ceaſe to be Chriſt, And for ſo long layes
aſide <hi>the ſweet ſavour of his oyntment,</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Pſalm. 45. 7, 8. Acts 10. 38. Acts 4. 27. 1 Ioh. 2. 27</note>.</p>
               <p>And ſo there muſt be an intermiſſion of his being Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
a Saviour; yea, and for ſo long is ſwallowed up of
Death; <hi>and then is his death void, we are yet in our ſinne.</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 2. 24. 1 Cor. 15. 17</note>.
For if the eternall ceaſe to be that which is in time, hee
cannot be Chriſt: for eternity and time muſt ever bee in
Chriſt, elſe he ceaſeth to be God &amp; Man, that <hi>Emanuel,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Iſa 7. 14. Mat. 1. 23.</note>

Chriſt of God,</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Rev. 22. 23 Luke 9. 20.</note>.</p>
               <p>So that if we deny eternity to the humanity, we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
deny, that the Deity was in time, and ſo deſtroy
Chriſt unto our ſelves, <hi>the faith of ſuch perſons is vaine,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 15 14.</note>.
Yet is the Deity or the Word in its own nature, ſimply,
eternall, and our nature or the humanity is in it ſelf, and
of its own nature ſimply momentany, and fading; but
the unity of them both is Chriſt, whoſe humanity is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
in the Word, and his divinity is as truly momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in our nature.</p>
               <p>So as take away the life of humane nature (ſo as the
Creature is extinct) for a moment, and take away the
life of the Son of God; yea, the very life of eternity: for
he never lived as a Saviour, but through death (nay, as
hath been ſaid) his death is his life: So that take away
that nature for a moment, wherein his death doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
and you make a nullity of our Lord Jeſus: So that
the doctrine of Chriſt, and the mortality of the ſoule, are
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64158:67"/>
utterly inconſiſtent, they cannot ſtand together.</p>
               <p>They therefore, that hold the mortality of the ſoule,
they muſt of neceſſity deny the reſurrection, the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and comming of our Lord Jeſus, it is in this caſe, as
our Apoſtle ſpeakes of the man and the wife; <hi>the man
hath not power of his own body, but the wife; and the wife
hath not power of her owne body, but the huſband,</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 4</note>
               </p>
               <p>Even ſo it is here God hath not power of that body of
excellency, grace and vertue, that is in himſelf, but hath
made it over unto us, for mans uſe and benefit.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe, we could not live unto him, conceive and
bring forth fruit acceptable and pleaſing unto him, being
of his owne begetting, and of his owne nature, as it is in
Chriſt,<note n="i" place="margin">Iam. 1. 18. 1 Ioh. 5. 1. 18 1 Pet. 1. 3. 2 Pet. 1. 14.</note>.</p>
               <p>Neither have we power of our own body, of infirmity
and frailty, but the Lord hath taken it unto himſelfe for
his own uſe: otherwiſe, hee could never dye, nor could
he without it generate, beget, and multiply himſelfe, as
he doth in Chriſt,<note n="k" place="margin">Iſa. 53. 10. Heb. 2. 10. Rom. 8. 16, 17.</note>, <hi>for he is the firſt begotten of death,</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Rov. 1. 5. Col. 1. 18.</note>,
and he can have no death in himſelfe, but as hee hath it in
us.</p>
               <p>So that if wee diſſolve this unity and contract for a

the Creator, and the Creature in Chriſt,<note n="m" place="margin">Hoſea 2. 16, 20. Iſa. 24. 5.</note>, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a nullity of it, and ſo make voyd our ſalvation,<note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 126. Rom. 4. 140</note>;
for if eyther of the parties ceaſe to be, ſo much as for a

then the Son of God ceaſeth to be a Saviour, if hee ceaſe
to be found in the Creature whom he ſaves, and the Son

               <p>So that thoſe that hold the mortallity of the ſoule of
man, <hi>which gives him his forme to be a man, and no other
Creature,</hi> they do as abſolutely and reſolutely deny that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64158:67"/>
glorious, happy, and fruitfull intercourſe, of life and
death that is betweene God and Man in Jeſus Chriſt;
for that which is the death of the Sonne of God, is the
life of the Sonne of ſorry man; and that which is the
death of the Sonne of ſorry man, is the life of the Son of
God.</p>
               <p>For the Sonne of GOD is made that in our nature,
that by nature hath no life of God in it, and ſo becomes
dead; or, is made that which is dead unto the things of
God.</p>
               <p>The Son of man is made that in the word, which by
nature hath no life of man (or life of a Creature in it)
and ſo becomes dead to the things of Man and of the one
and the other, doth Chriſt our Saviour conſiſt; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the one and the other, hee is not Chriſt, nor Jeſus at
all; for the mortality of mans ſoule, is nothing elſe but
the death and infirmity of the Sonne of God, and the
death and infirmity of the Sonne of God, is nothing elſe
but the life, perfection, and immortality of the Sonne of
Man: and no longer then the word of eternity (which
admits of no intermiſſion of time) can bee held or ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up of death,<note n="p" place="margin">Act. 2. 24. Pſal. 16. 10.</note>, no longer can the ſoule or nature
of man, (which is nothing but momentany or brittleneſſe

where by it liveth and endureth for ever,<note n="q" place="margin">Gal. 2. 20. Rom. 8. 9, 10, 11.</note>, in and by that
Word of God,<note n="r" place="margin">Col. 3. 16.</note>. For the ſonne of God hath no life as
a Saviour, but only in, and through death; nor the ſonne
of Man hath no death unto ſinne and ſorrow, as ſaved,
but in and through that life of the ſonne of God, which
is impoſſible to ceaſe for a moment; and ſo is that alſo,
that once lives thereby, and enjoyes it. Therefore, to
preach the ceſſation of the life of the ſoule, in laying aſide
for atime the life of the body, is no leſſe then to preach
the ceſſation of the life of the ſonne of GOD for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;

               <p>So that under that one act of death, all acts of death are

care, diligence, and frequencie obſerved by the Saints of

of a more higher and more ſpirituall nature, then is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of ſoule and body, being it is a ſeparation of God,
even from his own work, and an eternall emnity between
the Creature and the Creator; and yet this Curſe is a means
and way of the ſeparation of the ſoule and the body, &amp; of
the bodies lying down for a time in the duſt: But the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
and main thing the Scripture intends, when it ſpeaks
of death, is that ſpirituall and eternall death,<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 2. 17. Rom. 8. 13. 1 Cor. 15. 22</note> yet not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the other (namely the ſeparation of ſoule &amp; body,
unto which it alludes: So alſo is the reſurrection that is
by Chriſt of a more ſpirituall and heavenly nature, then
the riſing of the body out of the grave, or re-uniting of
ſoule and body in one againe; for it is that wonderfull u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and conjunction that is betweene God and Man in
Chriſt, who are made one out of ſuch an infinite diſtance,
as Man by nature is removed, and made remote by ſinne
&amp; corruption, from his Creator, in that his deſertion from
him at the firſt: therefore, where ever the reſurrection is
ſpoken of in the Scripture, it chiefly intends this ſpirituall
reſurrection that is by Jeſus Chriſt, not excluding the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of the body unto which it alludeth, &amp; elegantly
pointeth at: nor do we deny that this ſpirituall reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from ſinne, ſorrow, and eternall death by Jeſus Chriſt, is
the way and meanes of the reſurrection of the body out of
the grave, and re-uniting of the ſoule unto it: the laſt day.
But let us remember, that the work of our Salvation by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64158:70"/>
Chriſt is ſpiritual, And therefore take heed how we aſcribe
any thing of the glory of the reſurrection, unto the riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
of our bodies out of the grave, or to detract, or take
away from it, by the laying down of our bodies in the duſt,
knowing that all that the Lord Jeſus hath in us, is nothing
but death and deformity,<note n="u" place="margin">Iſa 52. 14. Iſa. 53. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note>, and that all our life &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
unto God our Father, is only in him<note n="x" place="margin">Col. 3. 3, 4. 2 Cor. 3. 18. Rom. 8. 29. Phil. 3. 10.</note>. So that
thoſe that aſcribe unto the Saints infirmity and weakneſſe,
becauſe of the laying aſide theſe naturall and corruptible
bodies for a ſeaſon, or conclude them then, to bee more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and powerfull when the body is raiſed, then before they
were, in the time of its being in the grave: This is but a
meere device, and ſubtil invention, to magnifie the fleſh,
by aſcribing ſomewhat unto it hereafter, which for the
preſent, they dare not doe, whereby they judge of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
according to the judgment and things of men, and
not according to the judgment and things of God,<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 2. 2. Ioh. 7. 24. Pſalm. 72. 2. Ioh. 8. 15, 16 Ioh. 5. 30.</note>, and
in this point our Interpreters contradict themſelves, who
affirme, that our Sanctification is perfected only at the time
of the death of this naturall and corporeall body, and that
the perfection of Sanctification, is Glorification; and yet
notwithſtanding, hold that our glorification is not perfect
and full, till our bodies ariſe out of the grave: this is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
that great miſtake of confounding that naturall death,
and that ſpirituall death together, not giving to each its
proper right and due, and ſo aſcribe more unto the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the body, then God hath put upon it; for Chriſt
hath nothing in, and by us, but meerly infirmity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and therefore, whatſoever is properly ours, or of our
ſelves, can adde nothing unto our glory; for all that wee
have of our ſelves as creatures, amounteth to no more, but
the compleat croſſe of the Son of God: So that all our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is in him, <hi>who never ſaw corruption,</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Pſalm. 16. 10.</note>, which great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
the Lord may ſeem to correct, knowing the operation

ſince, in regard of time; and far remote, in regard of place:
yet is it ſo made preſent as the Judge ſcruples not to give

For there is no uſe of witneſſe, where diſtance of actions

an infinite diſtance betwixt our operations by nature, and
the operations of the Son of God; &amp; ſentence being given
accordingly to condemn and ſilence the guilty, and cleere
and open the mouth of that innocent one: ſinne is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

particularly and diſtinctly, that governes our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>When the Scripture ſpeakes of death, it makes a large
Comment thereof, in ſuch a multitude of perſons, wayes,

unto; all which it is impoſſible to find upon any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

a mortall and momentary Creature. Now if God enlighten
our minds, &amp; extend them unto that large Comment and
Volume of the Croſſe, or of death, according to that ſpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

whereby we are made one with him, &amp; ſo communicate in

the Son of God is not the life, and fulneſſe of that faith,

whom we live, that in their Worſhip and Services uſed for

nothing but naturall operations to draw or to drive them

                  <note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 3. 7. Luke 3. 7.</note>, that ſuch a dipping or waſhing ſhould
ſave them from wrath to come, as hee performed it, being
that all that he did was but to ſhew what a turbulent Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan

(which was already in their hearts) and for no other end,
but that we might in him aſcend into that fountaine and

what Chriſt hath in our nature, and the Miniſtry of Chriſt
in his coming up, or aſcending out of the waters, with the
Spirit of God lighting, reſiding, or abiding upon him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
what we are in that divine nature of the Word, or
Son of God: Now theſe Jewes would be playing the part,
and preſuming to performe the Office of the Son of God,
(who deſcends downe into the depth of the wrath of his
Father) hoping thereby to eſcape wrath, even as our firſt
Parents entred into the way of death, in hope to eſcape it,
and to attaine life thereby, and in the meane time neglect,
contemne and deſpiſe that glory of the Son, which he in
that dipping or deſcention of his, doth ſo freely tender,
and offer unto them, for it is onely his part to deſcend and
be dipped in the waters of our weakneſſe, that have by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
no life nor Spirit of God in us at all, or into that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

and reſiding of that life, and Dove-like Spirit of God
upon us for ever<note n="u" place="margin">Mat. 3. 16</note>: the firſt of theſe is naturall, and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
unto all men, to dip, to dive, to ſprinckle and waſh

with materiall water, or to plunge themſelves into ſome
infirmity or weakneſſe of the fleſh, as faſting, mourning,
afflicting of themſelves, or the like, hoping thereby to
pleaſe God, for the appeaſing of his wrath, and ſo do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the Office of the Son of God, to undergoe the
Croſſe in themſelves, which is the very ſpirit of Antichriſt,
and in the meane time neglect and contemne the other,
namely that glorious reſurrection of our nature through
that reſidency of the Spirit upon it, whereby we are made
able to give Satan the foyle in all his temptations, even as
our Lord did by the power of his might<note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 4. 1.—11. Col. 1. 11. Phil. 4. 13. Rev. 2. 26, 27.</note>; Therefore in all
Baptiſms and Waſhings practiſed in the holy Scripture we
muſt know, that there is not any two performed alike, all
circumſtances conſidered, therefore that Church which
takes up the way of any particular of them alone, and of
it ſelfe, cannot practiſe nor performe the true Baptiſme,
when the whole Adminiſtration thereof (which the Holy
Ghoſt hath beene pleaſed to declare the right of it in ſo
many differing waies) is not brought in; therefore if wee
will profeſſe and practiſe the perfect Baptiſme unto which
our Apoſtle leads us, when he ſaith, <hi>let us goe on unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note>,
then we muſt unite and contract them all into one,
and ſo ſhall we finde the Ordinance of Baptiſme to bee
found faulty in all Churches under heaven, unleſſe they
have learned to center them all in one, and if they doe ſo,
it will not be found in any but onely in the Son of God,
whoſe dipping or waſhing comprehends them all, and ſo
hath in it all ſpirituall and holy dippings and waſhings
whatſoever, therefore if we ſet up another beſides that
which is perfected in him, we make an Idoll of it, and ſo
ſubject our ſelves unto wrath<note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1, to 7.</note>, for it is in this point of
Baptiſme as it is in the death of Chriſt, if we profeſſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
death (that is ſpirituall) beſides that which Chriſt hath
undergone, we make an Idoll of it, and ſubject our ſelves
thereby to the undergoing of that eternall death to come,
by uſurping and arrogating unto our ſelves the death of

and yet the very ſame thing, which is his Croſſe or Death,
doth alſo deſtroy and overthrow the wicked, for the Son
of God taking our nature into unity with himſelfe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> is that
which is properly his Croſſe or Death, <hi>he thereby ſuſtaining

and all thoſe things that Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered upon

doe ſet forth and declare what that one intire act of the

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64158:86"/>
we wrong both it, and all the reſt, and doe nothing

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64158:87"/>
walke by, and lay aſide all the reſt, for the Law of God is
multiplied, we ſee, in all other points as well as in this of

given unto Moſes in the Mount</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Exod. 34. 27. Deut. 10. 4.</note>, but infinitely in the holy

inſomuch, <hi>that he that breakes one Commandement is guilty
of all</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Iam. 2. 10, 11.</note>, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>I have written unto them the great

                  <note n="s" place="margin">Hoſ. 8. 12.</note>: but the word is, <hi>I have written unto them

So that if we will have one way of Baptiſme, and lay aſide
all the reſt, when as God hath diffuſed it in his Word into
ſo many wayes, then let us alſo (on the like ground) take
one of the Lawes of God, to be our rule to walk by, and
lay aſide all the reſt, the one of theſe will prove onely the

onely<note n="y" place="margin">Iude 10.</note>; for we grant in the things of men, that he that

well deny all grace to any member, as one grace; for, if
one, then any one; as the grace of juſtification, pardon of

have no leſſe reference and reſpect unto Chriſt, that word of

in-let of Satan, yea the proper power and kingdome of
darkneſſe, and compriſeth that whole brood and generation
of that man of ſin, and is that way of annullity, vaſtation,

<hi>Satan found nothing of himſelfe in Chriſt</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Iohn 14. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>our Saviour,</hi> ſo
is nothing of Chriſt found in that Sonne of perdition, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the whole, nor in any particular of him: ſo that in
every point his ſin is as capitall, and of no leſſe headſhip,
then is the putting to death of the Sonne of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> whoſe
life (in the leaſt) is no wayes found in him; thence it is
that the proper office of Chriſt aſſigned by God, <hi>is to cruſh
the aead of the Serpent</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 3. 15</note>, ſo that he never goeth out in his
true office of miniſterie, but he ſtrikes at the very head of
Antichriſt; for there is no ſin that reignes in any of the
ſonnes of men, that hath not in it the headſhip and domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Antichriſt; for it is of no leſſe guilt and crime, then
<hi>is the putting of the Lord of heaven and of earth unto death</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 8</note>:
So that thoſe that ſtrive and contend againſt ſinnes that are
not capitall, yea the very force and head of Satan in that
man of ſin, they never go forth in that Office and Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Sonne of God; <hi>for the ſeed of the woman is onely

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Iſa. 51 9. Pſal. 74. 14</note>; and at leſſe he never ſtrikes, then at the ring-leaders

the Sonne of the living God</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 6. 6.</note>: and yet notwithſtanding, it
cannot properly be ſaid that Satan foiles or overcomes the
Sonne of God, but is foiled and overcome himſelfe, for
<hi>Michael and his Angells overcome the Dragon and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Rev. 12. 7, to 11.</note>; therefore he is ſaid <hi>to bruiſe the heele of Chriſt,</hi> or as
the word ſignifies, to cruſh the print of the foot-ſole, that
is, he denies unto himſelfe that headſhip, power, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
that is peculiar and proper to the Sonne of God, whoſe
<hi>Kingdome and power is not of this world</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Iohn 18. 36.</note>, and in denying
that, he denies all the grace of the Sonne of God; for no
man can any more receive or apply that righteouſneſſe of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64158:90"/>
God in Chriſt, by faith to his juſtification, then he can attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
and apply the power, and authority of God unto
himſelfe, for his headſhip and domination, <hi>and ſo he cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the print of his foot-ſole,</hi> that is to ſay, he brings to nought
that thing that at the firſt had the very print, image, and
character of the Son of God upon it, for his heart confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
and his words and actions declare it, that the Lordſhip
and dominion of the Son of God is another thing, then
for the preſent he is converſant in and about, and this <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
or deniall of the headſhip of Chriſt, ſets him in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
oppoſition againſt Chriſt, ſeeking by all meanes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
himſelfe in the power and waies of the fleſh, which is
<hi>according to the letter that kills</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6.</note>, written in all mens hearts
which is the very print of the foot-ſole of Chriſt, declaring
the extent and depth of his humiliation, the form whereof
Satan cruſheth, and bringeth to nought in himſelfe, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing
of it in himſelfe, making it of leſſe extent then
indeed it is, and ſo maketh the headſhip of Chriſt of no other
uſe unto himſelfe, but to give dimenſion unto his ſin, <hi>which
kindleth wrath in himſelfe for ever</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 2. 4, 5, 6. Gal. 4. 24.</note>; for he that confeſſeth
himſelf to be really and indeed that only bottomleſs gulf of
Chriſt his humiliation, cannot but acknowledge Chriſt to be
really and indeed that onely and alone height of his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore it is, that Chriſt cruſheth the Serpents
head, that is, extends the fleſh unto its height and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
which cannot reſt, unleſſe by eating it may bee like
God<note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note>, which diſpoſition or condition Chriſt takes into u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with himſelfe in us, which is the very depth and ſtate
of his humiliation, and hereby deſtroyes it, which act is his
great victory and exaltation for ever<note n="h" place="margin">Acts 8. 33</note>, making it to bee of
no other uſe, but meerly to give dimenſion unto his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and glory for ever, that it may appeare unto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of what eminency, height, and dignity it is, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
could not appeare.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, what though things be thus in Jeſus
Chriſt, which we willingly acknowledge, yet what is that
to mee for my preſent comfort and peace? how may I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64158:90"/>
know that theſe things belong to my ſelfe? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> Let me in love
anſwer, in the words of the Apoſtle in caſe of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>Thou foole</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 36.</note>; canſt thou give Chriſt a true forme and
being in mans nature, and yet there is but one nature of
man, which thou haſt and art, (<hi>for by nature wee are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 3 Rom. 3. 10. 11. 12.</note>) and yet canſt not give him a forme in thy ſelfe? it is
impoſſible ſo to be: So that, the forming of Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us, being in our ſelves deſtitute of his life, love, ſpirit,
and power, is meerly imaginary, hiſtoricall, traditionall, and
and that will vaniſh in time of need; and not reall, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the dictate of the ſpirit, <hi>in the power of faith, through
which the Saints are kept unto, or in ſalvation</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note>, <hi>for hee hath a
name given unto him that none can know but himſelfe</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Rev. 19. 12.</note>; and
to affirme that we are able to give Chriſt a true forme and
being, out of our ſelves doctrinally, and yet that he is not in
our ſelves, operating and working effectually, is as much as
to affirme, we can give Chriſt a true forme and being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mans nature, which the word of God knowes not, nor
ever did; for he is that onely and alone way unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<note n="n" place="margin">John 14. 6.</note>, yea he had never the relation of a Sonne unto the
Father, but through death; for if ever he had cloſed with
the Father in any other way, he had never taſted death for
us<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note>, <hi>for the Lord our righteouſneſſe cannot change</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Ier. 23. 6. Mal. 3. 6.</note> in any
thing, then not in his relation unto the Father; ſo that it
was ever through death, and he never had death but in us,
which once granted, is the very in-let of life unto us for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Nay to conclude, we give Chriſt a true forme and being
as he was framed in our nature in the wombe of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<note n="q" place="margin">Luk. 1. 35</note>, and yet are deſtitute of his being framed and faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in our hearts and converſations<note n="r" place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>by faith,</hi> to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in the edification of others, is all one, as if a man ſhould
affirm himſelf to be able to frame a place for the ſafety of a
man in a rock impregnable, and yet himſelfe could not be in
ſafety thereby; <hi>for Chriſt is that rocke of ages</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Deut. 32. 18. 31.</note>: where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
faith gives him his true proportion: further, to give
Chriſt his true forme without us, and yet to bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the comfort and fruit of his dwelling, and being reſident
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64158:91"/>
in us by his grace (and that apparently) is as if a man ſhould
affirm, that the eye is of uſe, and onely ſees for it ſelfe, but
not for the body in which it is, nor is of that uſe, as to be the
light of it<note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 6. 22 Luke 11. 34</note>, for the eyes ſees properly for the body, rather
then for it ſelfe; for, <hi>If the eye be ſingle, the whole body is
light;</hi> yea the hand ſees to work, and the foot to walk, as
apparently, as if ſuch a member were the eye it ſelfe, becauſe
it is in the body. Now Chriſt is that eye, and that <hi>fountaine
of life and light; and in his light onely it is that wee ſee
light</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 36. 9</note>: even as in this naturall Sun, we cannot ſee it but by
its own light, and if we ſee it ſo, we cannot but ſee it for, and
upon our ſelves; ſo that if we ſee Chriſt in any reſpect, in his
own light, we cannot but ſee him for our owne conſolation,
(even in that reſpect, whatever it may be) yea and that in,
and upon our ſelves; for the eye ſees not, nor hath that life
and ſenſe of ſight, but as it hath confluence with the body;
even ſo, our Lord never manifeſted that life and ſpirit of
his, which is the light and revelation of himſelfe, but as hee
hath confluence with that <hi>body given unto him, or eare bored
thorough</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 40. 6 Heb. 10. 5.</note>, by which he lives through death, and becomes
light out of darkneſſe, which none but the Sonne of God
himſelfe can either be, or performe: and thence it is, <hi>that
darkneſſe covering the face of the deep,</hi> in that great morning
and early day in the beginning of the world<note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 1. 2. Iob 38. 4. to 15.</note> teacheth us
what it is; for the Spirit of God to brood upon thoſe vaſt
waters of our nature, being in our ſelves no leſſe then that
deep myſtery of iniquity; ſo that, as that word of command
at the firſt, brought out light even out of that darkneſſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Let there be light, and it was ſo,</hi> or rather by that oath
of interpoſition (which is taught therein, even from the
beginning) which giveth light in our Lord for ever; for
the word tranſlated [<hi>let</hi>] ſignifies <hi>ſo be it,</hi> or <hi>ſo it is,</hi> or <hi>ſhall
be,</hi> or <hi>amon,</hi> or <hi>verily it is ſo,</hi> having in it the vertue of an
oath, binding over the creature, in the vertue and power of
the word of God, to be obedient and ſubject thereunto for
ever; even ſo that ſpirit, that gives life by Jeſus Chriſt, broods
upon our nature, which in it ſelfe is corruptible (and in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64158:91"/>
depth of death through our fall) brooding therein, and
bringing forth that <hi>light of life that is by Ieſus Chriſt</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6 Ioh. 1. 4, 5</note> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are given to underſtand how to judge of that unity,

of God, whereof <hi>Chriſt is the beginning, or head</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 3. 14</note>, even
as light gives ability to judge rightly of the forme and figure
of all things in this preſent world; therefore the Apoſtle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legantly
alludes unto that firſt worke in the creation of the
world, in teaching of this doctrine, ſaying, <hi>God who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts,
the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6</note>: So that the confluence of darkneſſe is the very
production or propagation of light, the Sonne of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
that in us, which according to our light, is nothing
but darkneſſe, wee become that in him that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but light; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Ye were darkneſſe</hi>
(or as the word will beare, <hi>ye are darkneſſe) but ye are made
light in the Lord, walke therefore as children of light</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 8.</note>. Yea this
queſtioning, whether Chriſt be ours or no, at preſent, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but that grand queſtion propounded in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
whether we have the image of God (making us corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
unto his will in all things) or no, but muſt ſeek out
ſome tree and fruit to make us wiſe, that we may attaine it,

                  <note n="d" place="margin">Col. 1. 15</note>, and that he was made ſo in our nature, yea in and for
us<note n="e" place="margin">Col. 3. 10. 2 Cor. 3. 18.</note>; therefore the queſtion is the ſame that ever it was, and
alſo the demurres and debates about it, and how to attaine
it, are thoſe proper reaſonings of the woman and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
even to this day<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 3. 1. 6 2 Cor. 11. 3</note>; as alſo the iſſues thereof are the
ſame<note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 3. 7, 8. Rev. 3. 17, 18.</note> and that is always the ſubject matter of his doctrine,
the way of his inſtruction and counſell, when the woman,
the weaker veſſell<note n="h" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 7</note>, yea that wiſdome of man, and not of
God<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4 5. 13. 2 Cor. 1. 12</note> holds diſpute and diſcourſe in point of religion, but
when the manchild is brought forth, ſo as the woman holds
no diſpute with the Serpent, no more then a woman
can hold diſpute with any whether her travell be neare or
no, but apply her ſelfe to the preſent work, in the height and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64158:92"/>

(though ſhie and ſubtill ſerpent<note n="k" place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 3.</note>) becomes a fierce,

ſeeking by that meanes to regulate and make perfect the
world: ſee this point for the concluſion of it, in the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the operation of the minde of a wife to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
that is faithfull and true unto him, and alſo of one that
hath broken the marriage bond; in caſe wee conceive, wee
think we conceive and eſteeme highly of Chriſt, but queſtion
whether his dignity and excellency be ours yea or no; for, a
faithfull wife, hearing the praiſes of her husband, and his
proweſſe and vertues ſet forth, ſhe rejoyceth, and it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
her better, then if ſhe were commended her ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his praiſes are hers, which in her ſelfe could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be ſo eminent, ſhe being the weaker veſſell, as alſo true
love ever gives honour unto the party beloved, and not to it
ſelfe, which ſhewes that matrimoniall and conjugall tie and

that it is onely the work of the Spouſe to ſet forth the

commendation be given to her ſelfe, or to her harlot:
thence it is, that the titles, offices, vertues and operations,
that are in Jeſus Chriſt are nothing unto us according to
our owne naturall and carnall thoughts, unleſſe we can have
them of our owne creation, forming, faſhioning, polliſhing,
and ſetting up in our ſelves, and others beſides himſelfe, and
when we have adulterated, and given that to another which
is peculiar unto himſelfe alone, then we can delight in, and
make merry with them, and never thinke too much of their
praiſes, as the ſpirit of every Adultreſſe doth, which was the
ground of apoſtatizing Iſrael of old, his dancing about the

which doth infallibly and undeniably (according to the

Chriſt, in whomſoever it ſpeaks according to the teſtimony
thereof, or elſe no judgement is paſſed in the houſe of God,
according to the miſtery of godlineſſe, and thus much for
the preſent, in way of explanation of the oath of interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition:
the next thing noted in the Text, is the unchangeable
nature of his oath of interpoſition, laid downe in theſe

               <p>That is to ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> will never change the nature and forme of
this Oath, nor the manner and way of the adminiſtration of

unity that is between God and man in Jeſus Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſwears by nothing but by himſelfe, that is, by that

                  <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 6. 13 14. 15.</note>, it is true alſo, and ſhall never change,

Oath of Confirmation</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 6. 16</note>, which implies that to be within the

by vertue of this unrepentant Oath that abideth for ever,

in his private ſtudies as a learner of him, or in his prayers
as one in abſolute want and neceſſity, to be onely ſupplyed
by him, or in any of his deliverances, as weake and fraile
in himſelfe to give the glory to God alone further the in
all his Adminiſtrations in the houſe of God, he can reckon
and account of himſelfe, the very ſame in all reſpects with
any of the flock of God, without which he cannto give the

is it in this point of glory, if we detain it in one point, we
detain it in all: from this ground it is, that our Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes,
<hi>that he is all things in all men,</hi> for ſo the word is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rendred<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 22.</note>, <hi>that by all meanes or in all waies I might propoſe

                  <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 23.</note>; ſo as that whatever
you are, or have, I am and have the ſame with you, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I have or am, you are and have the like; <hi>for they that run

                  <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 24.</note>: ſo that we

I ſtruck at things upon uncertainties, as though I knew not

be in ſome thing, and then in all things, if I be not the
ſame with you, and you with me in all things that concern
the grace of the Goſpell; ſuch is that body which the Saints
or Miniſters of Chriſt doe beat downe, which gives to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one the ſame image and forme by nature that it gives to

it we were not <hi>ſhame</hi> by nature, <hi>his glory and honour</hi> could
not be lifted up and advanced in us<note n="ſ" place="margin">Iſa. 61. 2.</note>, if we were not <hi>death,</hi>
no place for the life <hi>of the Son of God</hi> to make it ſelfe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<note n="t" place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 9, 10.</note>, ſo that if any deny himſelfe, any of thoſe infirmities
which mans nature is by ſin ſubjected unto, he denies unto
himſelfe likewiſe, <hi>that long and beautifull white robe which
is put upon all the Saints by Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Rev. 7. 9, 10, 13, 14.</note>, and if we deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any of the Saints any office, excellency, or dignity in the

then do we alſo deny unto ſuch that compleat body of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
<hi>that all by nature are wrapped up in</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Eph. 2. 3.</note>, which is the
very way of putting on all the precious ornaments and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64158:94"/>
of the Lord Jeſus<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note>, therefore it is, <hi>that in the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of this earthly Tabernacle, we have a building not made

                  <note n="z" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1</note>, <hi>nor doe we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality may bee
ſwallowed up of life:</hi> that is, we doe not deſire our weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and infirmities to be ſo anihilated as not to be, for then
there were no body whereupon the heavenly ornaments are
to bee put, out we deſire to be ſo clothed upon, that nothing
but the truth, power, holineſſe, life and glory of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven may appeare upon us, which is the <hi>ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
up, devouring, or deſtruction of mortality by life</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 4</note>, of
ſuch nature is the miniſtration, that is unrepentant, being
exerciſed according the office of our high Prieſt, <hi>entred
within the vaile, yea into very heaven it ſelfe</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 9. 24 Heb. 6. 20.</note>, <hi>which is after the
order of Melchizedeck,</hi> and all other waies of Prieſthood
and Miniſtration will find a time of repentance and change,
<hi>being onely after the order of Aaron</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 7. 11.</note>, making difference in
the creature of the dignity and office of the Son of God in
the Church, and ſo indeed <hi>ſpeakes evill of dignities,</hi> or deny
and vilifie the one dignity that is not found but in the Son
of God alone<note n="d" place="margin">Iude 8.</note>, which is only made manifeſt and multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and entire, without the leaſt fraction, to whomſoever it fals<note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 22. 18 John 19. 24.</note>;
and hence it comes to paſſe, that the Lord can never repent
of, change or alter this Prieſthood and Miniſtrie, becauſe his
whole mind and will is fully completed and perfected, for
ever in his Son, in whom or in what point ſoever this oath,
office or Miniſtry appeareth<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 3. 16, 17. Iohn 17 18 2 Cor. 3 1, 2 3, 4, 5, 6.</note>, for the Son holds correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency

which this oath of interpoſition onely comprizeth, who

repenteth</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 6. 6.</note>, we are to underſtand, that he who by nature ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

there is one thing overcome in this Prieſthood, that is our

at all,</hi> (as the word ſignifies) ſo that ſuch as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or being of Chriſt is, ſuch alſo is his Office and Miniſtery;
but the Perſon or being of Chriſt (<hi>our Melchizedek</hi>) is
without father and mother, ſo alſo is his office and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery:
now the perſon or ſubſiſtance of Chriſt, is without
father, (on this wiſe) for the holy and pure God never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
or produced any thing of the fleſh, which the Word
was made<note n="m" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 14</note>, and tooke it into unity with it ſolfe, without
which Chriſt is not, that is, the father never produced or
propagated any weakneſſe, infirmity, or frailty which is
properly that fleſh that the word tooke into unity, for
he bare our ſins, and carried our ſorrowes<note n="n" place="margin">Iſa. 53. 4.</note>, and was made
ſubject to our frailties and infirmities which are not without,
but in theſe materiall ſouls and bodies of ours<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 26 38 Luke 24. 39 40. Pſal. 22. 16</note>, which heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſores,
ſickneſſes, and ſorrowes<note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 8. 17</note>, God could never produce,
<hi>who is the fountaine of life</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 36. 9 Jer. 2. 13.</note>, no more then a pure fountaine
can ſend out uncleane and corrupt waters<note n="r" place="margin">Iam. 11. 12.</note>; therefore as he
ſuſtained our infirmities and weakneſſes, he was without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for he was never produced, propagated, or generated
after the fleſh, nor received the leaſt ſpirit or livelihood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the fleſh, but altogether according to the ſpirit,
<hi>For he was borne not of blood, nor of the fleſh, nor of the will of
man, but of God</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Iohn 3 6. Iohn 1. 13. Iohn 1. 14.</note>: and therfore in regard of the fleſh, which
indeed he became, he was without father; for he never lived
after it, nor was begotten nor brought forth according to
the luſts and deſires thereof. Now ſuch as he is, ſuch alſo is
his Office and Miniſterie; for any thing that may receive
forme and being, preſervation and continuation amongſt
men, by ſtudy, art, humane learning, tradition, or the like, it
can be nothing of this Office and Miniſterie, it is a higher

yet that which he truly was, never did nor eve can conceive,
cheriſh, or bring forth the Son of the living God; For, <hi>the
fleſh, or the naturall man, conceives not the things that are of
God, for they are ſpiritually to bee conceived, diſcerneall and

brought forth</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14</note>, which the fleſh is not, neither can it doe it;
ſo that the word of God miniſtreth nothing, in the being or
ſubſiſtance of Chriſt, to add any thing unto the fleſh, or
unto that weakneſſe which hee tooke upon him; for then
weakneſſe ſhould naturally flow out of ſtrength, as out of
its proper fountain, which it cannot do; nor doth the fleſh
miniſter any thing unto the Word of God, in this bringing
forth of Chriſt, in the conception or cheriſhing thereof, for
then ſhould it be a fountaine and cauſe of that, which is the
fountaine and cauſe of all things: God then in the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his Sonne adds nothing at all in miniſtring unto the
fleſh, nor the Spouſe in conceiving of Chriſt addeth nothing
in miniſtring unto the ſpirit, nor in the diminution or anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilating
of the fleſh; ſo that the great skill of the work is,
to bring forth the one and the other, in direct oppoſition in
all points, and that is the true forme of that infinite and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Sonne of God, which can never be done, but by the
light of the Spirit: for nature cannot conceive the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to bee at an infinite diſtance and diſproportion with his
owne work, nor can this be ſeen, but the unity of them both
is concluded; for the condition of the one, having loſt the
image of God, is of infinite emptineſſe and vaſtneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the loſſe is of an infinite nature and value, and that
royall perfection of the other (that ever abides the ſame,
and knows how to bring gain and profit out of all things<note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 6</note>)
is of infinite fulneſſe and validity, ſo that theſe two become
the very proper centers, receptacles, dwelling, and abiding
places of one another for ever<note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 17. 21, 23.</note>, <hi>which is the ſwallowing up
of mortality by life</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 4</note>, <hi>and that victory of faith that overcomes

and of ſuch nature is the office and miniſtery of Chriſt in the

one can deſcribe a Prieſt, Office or Miniſtery of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,

another kind and ſtock, then he and his Miniſtery is, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

void of him, <hi>who abideth a Prieſt for ever</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 7. 24.</note>; ſo that a Prieſt
and a Miniſtery that will end both in the one, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
yea a Prieſt and a Miniſtery that one may have a being
without the uſe and exerciſe of the other, is not after the
manner, nor according to the order of this our <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek,</hi>
but after the manner of man, and according to his
art, skill, device and invention, which the wiſdome of the
Sonne of God permits not, nor approves of; neither can it
be had in account, reckoning, genealogie, kindred, ſtock,
pedegree; or in the leaſt to be according to the deſcent, or
proceed of it; but contrarily, as it is of man, ſo doth it
tend unto man; breeding, or rather bringing forth meere
humane principles, tending to the <hi>crucifying of the Sonne
of God</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 6 7, 8, 9.</note>, even as that Jewiſh Prieſthood ever did<note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 2. 1, 2, 3. Mat. 26. 3, 4. Iohn 12. 9, 10, 11.</note>, yea
all Miniſteries being of that kinde in the root, beare
the ſame fruit unto this day; nor can they doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<hi>For men cannot gather grapes of thornes, nor figgs
of thiſtles</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">1 Mat. 7. 16</note>, therefore is the Miniſtery of Chriſt further
diſtinguiſhed from them all, being the Prieſt, as alſo the
Office are ſuch, <hi>who neither have beginning of dayes, nor end

<hi>the word was made fleſh,</hi> yet he never began, nor propoſed
a platform unto himſelfe, to live, or give light unto the

world after the fleſh, although the Son of God was made the
Sonne of man, yet did, he never breath as to live after the

Prince of this world found ſomthing in him<note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 14. 30</note>, <hi>whereupon to

in the Sonne of God</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19</note>: therefore is he truly ſaid to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
beginning of dayes, becauſe however he was a man,
yet did never live for a moment after the will and naturall
deſires of man<note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 22. 42. Ioh. 1. 13.</note>, who alwayes lives unto himſelfe, but

                  <note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 17. 19 Ioh. 10. 15. 17.</note>: and
of ſuch nature is his Office and Miniſtery, that however it is

<hi>whileſt as yet there was none of them:</hi> that is, none of them
according to the fleſh, or in ſuch ſort as the naturall art or

them at all. And hence ariſe all thoſe contentions that are
about Chriſt in the world: for he is not in the leaſt to be
found, living, or giving light unto men for a day, no not for
one moment, according to the fleſh. And hence it is, that all
are in contention in giving ſeverall formes and figures for
his production and bringing forth in the world: nor can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
think or imagine, that any power and glory of his can
greatly appeare in the Church, according to the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <note n="f" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5, 6, 7.</note>; but as this order of Prieſthood is without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of daies, ſo is it alſo without end of life, that is, as Chriſt
lives being a man, yet never lived according to the minde
and will of man, but according to the will of God, ſo hee
alſo dies being true God, but never dies unto the Spirit and
Life of God, but onely dies unto that which is the proper
Spirit and reaſoning of that which is meerly carnall and
humane in man<note n="g" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 18. Eph. 2. 15, 16.</note>, which naturally is mans onely life, Chriſt
dies then (being the Son of God<note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 3. 16 1 Cor. 2. 8.</note>) in that he becomes, that
which is death it ſelfe, having no life of God in it at all<note n="i" place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 1.</note>,
yet it is as impoſſible that the life of the Son of God ſhould
be extinct for a moment, as it is for God to ceaſe to bee,
who gives being unto all things<note n="k" place="margin">Iohn 1. 1, 2, 3. Acts 17. 27, 28.</note>, therefore muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
be without end of life: So Chriſt lives being a man,
but as impoſſible to live after the will of man, or deſires
of the fleſh, as it is that one onely Son of God ſhould have
two ſubſiſtences or beings<note n="l" place="margin">Deut. 6. 4. Gal. 3. 20. 1 Tim. 2. 5.</note>, or <hi>that one fountaine ſhould ſend
forth both ſweet water and bitter</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Iames 3. 11, 12.</note>; or that the Son of God
ſhould admit of ſuch an emptineſs in himſelfe, as that ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beſides himſelfe muſt fill up and repleniſh: ſo that the
death of the Son of God is properly in man, (but yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that interchangeable Covenant, mutuall act and
intercourſe of the operation of faith) is tranſlated and

                  <note n="n" place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 14 1 Cor. 15. 54, 55.</note>. The life alſo of the Son
of mortall man is properly in God, but according to that
forenamed mutual act &amp; operation of faith, is tranſlated and
transferred even unto the Son of ſorry man<note n="o" place="margin">Col. 3. 3, 4 Phil. 3. 20, 21.</note>, otherwiſe
<hi>could righteouſneſs and peace never have gotten victory,</hi> nor

its Creatour<note n="p" place="margin">Iohn 4. 14. Rom. 6. 22, 23. Iohn 3. 36. Iohn 6. 40.</note>: So that as hee never hath beginning, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the workes, waies, and devices of the fleſh, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
hee never hath end, in the operations and Ordinances,
according to the wiſdom of the Spirit, in which the myſtery
of the Goſpel appears to be this, that the very act of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64158:100"/>
is the very act of reſtauration by Jeſus Chriſt; for the
death and deſtruction of the Son of God, according to the
fleſh in us, is our life and reſtauration in the Spirit through
him, and this myſtery lying hid, the very name of the Croſs
of Chriſt <hi>becomes a feare, a terrour, a reproach and a ſtumbling
ſtone unto all the world,</hi> which comes to paſs, by that being
taught for the Croſs of Chriſt, which is nothing elſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
but the jealouſies, ſuſpitions, feares, and terrours
of Satan, concluding the Croſs to be a hard, heavy, ſhameful
and uncomfortable thing, which is indeed the moſt glorious
act or thing that ever was, or ſhall be done, or brought
forth by the Son of the eternall God to the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for ever: therfore the Apoſtle further deſcribes him to
be <hi>like the Son of God</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 7. 3.</note>, <hi>or made like the Son of God, or reckoned
unto, or made to bee the Son of God.</hi> Now as he is naturally
the love and boſome of the Father, who is God, ſo he cannot
be ſaid, to be made, or reckoned, or accounted unto ſuch a
ſtate, or thing, but in &amp; by his croſs, or taking our nature into
unity with himſelf; he is made to be ſuch a one, of that which
by nature is a ſon of ſorrow, a child of death, and ſo through
the croſſe becomes <hi>triumphant over all principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and hath made a ſhew of them openly</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Col. 2. 14, 15.</note>, which otherwiſe
could never have appeared, and ſo continues a Prieſt for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and therefore the Pſalmiſt gives him that regall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and authority that pertaineth and belongeth unto his
Kingly Office alſo, laid down in theſe words:</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>5. Verſ. The Lord at thy right hand ſhall wound (or ſtrike

               <p>The Kingly power to execute vengeance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> and the Prieſtly
office ſacrificing to procure mercy, are never ſeparated nor
put aſunder, of which we have an embleme in all naturall
ſtates and Miniſteries; for the King is not willing to execute
wrath without the counſell and advice of the Miniſtery, and
the Prieſt is not willing nor free to Miniſter, to procure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
(in what way ſoever hee takes mercy to be attained in)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64158:101"/>
without the defence, maintenance, and protection of the
Magiſtrate: and this place the Pſalmiſt takes alſo, out of the
fourteenth of <hi>Geneſis</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 14. 1.</note>, and here we muſt remember, that as
there is a Kingly Prieſt, and a Prieſtly King ſitting at the
right hand of each other in honour, (as in the beginning of
this Pſalme) although in a diverſe acceptation, ſo alſo there
are Kings in the plurall number, that are ſubjected unto

unto the croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
&amp; really another thing, then the natural mind of man
can comprehend or conceive of: for we naturally conceive,
that thoſe things which are penall, and troubleſome unto
man, vexations, griefs, perturbations, and anguiſhes felt, and
painfully and burdenſomly undergone, are the croſs of
Chriſt, yea ſorrows and fears, and pinching and painfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
we naturally extol, as the only ſuffering that brings
deliverance and joy unto us, which is the worlds great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
of the croſs of Chriſt, from the beginning ever untill

are in repentance; but repentance is ever a change, wherein
the Son of God is found, or els it cannot be repentance ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

this is the portion which he takes unto himſelfe, for the utter

                  <note n="i" place="margin">Iſa. 53. 4, 5, 6.</note>, (which is no leſs

ſit downe in the very chaire and ſeat of Antichriſt, aſſuming
that great work of the ſuffering of the Son of God unto

cannot be: for, if a man do arrogate unto himſelfe any part
or point of trouble and bitterneſſe of the creature, ſo as to
be the croſs of Chriſt, then hath the Son of God died in
vain, for he muſt either become all ſorrow, or els none at all,
ſo that the whole ſuffering belongs onely unto the Creator,
<hi>that could not be overcome of death</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 2, 24</note>, and the whole and full
releaſe belongs only unto the creature, for nothing elſe had

was in feare and bondage in it ſelfe, ſubject to death</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 2. 14 15.</note>, but by

ſtated in his life and peace for ever<note n="o" place="margin">Col. 3. 3. Iohn 16. 33 Eph. 2. 14.</note>; and yet we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
in this point the ſenſible, or rather ſenſuall penalties and
pinings of the creature, which man is ſubjected unto, with
the reſt of the animall parts of the creation, as being ſubject
in this life to ſome things which other creatures are, even as
to eat, drink, ſleep, procreate, and the like; ſo alſo to have bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
aches, ſickneſs, ſores, famine, weakneſs, and the like,
which are troubles and diſturbances to one creature, as well
as to another (both of man and beaſt) till it come to death

therefore ſo prevents them, extenuates, or brings a quite

                  <note n="u" place="margin">Gal. 6 14 Iames 1. 2.</note>, which in themſelves to all fleſh is grief, anguiſh,

they are naturally no ſuch things<note n="z" place="margin">Gen. 1. 31. 1 Tim. 4. 4.</note>; ſo that the Croſs
of Chriſt is of a more eminent and tranſcendent nature then
theſe temporary and fading things can reach unto; for
that which is of an eternall nature, extent and value, cannot
conſiſt in temporall things, although it may be exerciſe and
made known in that which in it ſelf is temporary: the proper
Croſs of Chriſt then is that in man, which is peculiar and
proper unto man alone, and cannot be found in any other
creature whatſoever, and makes man to be that which by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he is, which no other creature can be ſuch, that is, all that
emnity and wrath, defection from God, and rebellion againſt
him, which ariſeth from the breach of that unity, covenant,
and agreement that was between the Creator, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the firſt act of its creation; for none of the creatures
being made in the Image of God but man alone, it was not
poſſible that any could make a breach, or deprive it ſelfe
of ſuch an Image and being, but onely hee; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
man onely acquires and attracts ſuch an enmity and
wrath unto himſelfe, as no other creature could ever doe
but hee alone: So that which ariſeth properly from a
breach, that hath in it that which is eternall, is the Croſs of
Chriſt, but man onely hath an enmity and wrath naturally,
that ariſeth from a breach that is eternall, therefore none but
man can participate in that which is properly the Croſs of
Chriſt, and he only and alone can do it, for in this breach God
himſelf is the party falne from, caſt off, and by adulterating
the ſtate and condition of the contract, utterly rejected; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatever ariſeth hence, muſt needs be of an eternall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
becauſe it hath ever reſpect unto him who is eternal, and
of ſuch nature is the Croſs of Chriſt, in what point or
particular ſoever it is taught unto us, or to be conſidered of
by us in, which if that Son of eternity had not taken upon
himſelf, never could any have extended himſelfe therein, ſo
as to have been a plenary ſatisfaction to God, or to the

conſcience of the creature<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 20. 28 1 Ioh. 2. 1, 2</note>, but hee having taken it
upon himſelfe, who is infinite and eternall, muſt of nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſity
reach unto, and take in the utmoſt bounds of it in
every point and tittle thereof, otherwiſe there would
not be a place ſufficient for <hi>that infinite love and garment

that whatſoever the King doth in his regal authority, he

was indeed his death<note n="o" place="margin">Iſa. 53, 5, 6,</note>; then muſt it of neceſſity be ſuch a
death as is never vacant of life; ſo that the life, ſpirit, and

then ſhould the life of the Son of God admit of a ceſſation,
for ſome time, which can in no wiſe be granted, no not ſo
much as for a moment<note n="p" place="margin">Iames 1, 17, Pſal, 90, 1, 2,</note>, therefore his life and death are

and death whatſoever<note n="q" place="margin">Epheſ, 5, 8, Mat, 6, 22, Pſal, 97, 11,</note>, that they cannot faſten themſelves

over ſo many in this world, having captivated them under

ſo as to make liveleſs, and voyd of operation, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

of all operations of his grace in and upon himſelf, and ſo is
no other but a dead man in ſins and treſpaſſes, ſignified <hi>by

thereby is that other King, or Kings (in the plural number)
pierced, blaſphemed, or ſtruck through by our Lord, in that
man of his right hand, which is the pride, proſperity, oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and arrogancy of the ſonnes of men, attributing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themſelves that which is the right and due of the Son of
God in the houſe and kingdom of God, and that is on this
wiſe, our high Prieſt, or Sacrificer, makes manifeſt his death
in the ſlaying and ſacrificing of all the fat and the ſweet,
that is in the beauty, glory, excellency, and goodlineſs of man,
no otherwiſe but in the King that ſon of his right hand;
namely, in that life and reſurrection of that Son of man, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom all power in heaven and in earth is given, becauſe he
is the Son of man</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Iohn 5, 27.</note> (elſe could it not be given, for as he is

<hi>he over all God bleſſed for ever</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 9, 5.</note>: So that according to that
variety of life, ſpirit, principality, ſupereminency &amp; excellency
that is in the Son of man, even ſuch is the death, ſhame, and
dejection of the excellency and glory of man; therefore as
the excellency and glory of him that is the Son of God muſt
needs be infinite and boundleſs, even ſo muſt it neceſſarily
follow, that the pride, glory, and goodlineſs of man muſt
be in all points and at all times dryed up and altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged
that it appear not in this way of life and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Iſa, 40. 6, 7. Pet, 1. 23, 24</note>: So that the death

wrought out and made manifeſt no other way but in

to the curioſity of that Regiment and Government, ſuch is
that noble death and ſacrifice of our high Prieſt: So that the

death and life are one and the ſame acts and muſt needs be
ſo, elſe had the Son of God injoyed life for a time without,
death, which if once he had done ſo, he had then ever done

                  <note n="b" place="margin">Jer, 23, 6: Mal. 3. 6.</note>, and then

                  <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor, 15. 16, 17.</note>,
which far be it from us, or as it is tranſlated, <hi>God forbid</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Rom, 6, 15</note>,
that we ſhould ever think; and thus doth our Lord ſtrike
through, pierce, or blaſpheme the pride, proſperity, that
the earthly excellency and goodlineſs of man leaving it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
liveleſs and voyd of any power to lay hold or to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
upon him who is the Son of God, as to move him in
the leaſt to ſpeak great things in himſelf according to the

thoſe temptations, ſuggeſted by that great enemy of our
ſalvation<note n="e" place="margin">Luke 4, 13.</note>, ſo that none of them could in the leaſt take hold
of him; in which power and victory we only ſtand: and
this is the work of our Lord and high Father <hi>Abraham</hi> in
the ſlaughter of the Kings, together with our good <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech,</hi>
who hath the truth of all; and it is a work that is

                  <note n="f" place="margin">Exod, 3, 14. Rev, 1, 4.</note>:
and howſoever unto a natural eye and ear it ſeems to lay
waſte the houſe of <hi>God,</hi> of any actions or operations of the
Saints at all, becauſe it denies man his natural excellencies
and abilities of the fleſh (according to natural and humane
wiſdom to work by,) yet it is nothing elſe but an exchange
of the things of man for the things and operations of the
Son of <hi>God,</hi> in caſe we do but know <hi>how to put our talent
into the bankery or to the exchangers</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Mat, 25, 27.</note>, and not do as that
unprofitable ſervant did, to hide it in a napkin: for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
given is the mind, wiſdom, or will of the Son of <hi>God</hi>
unto mankind, and ſo is a gift which man, by art and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
wiſdom, finely wraps up, even as in a napkin, hiding
it or keeping it apart by it ſelf in thoſe earthly thoughts and
counſels of his own mind and underſtanding and puts it
not into the bankery (which is) that unity of God and man
in Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo it doth not increaſe by exchange,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64158:109"/>
namely, of the things of man tranſlated and made over unto
<hi>God,</hi> as alſo the things of <hi>God</hi> tranſlated and made over

of thoſe great riches of our Lord that are found in the
life and death of Jeſus Chriſt (which is all one to do)
namely to make one, to become many, by bringing it into
the bankery, or putting it to the exchangers, which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and yet it is but one (in reſpect of unity) or elſe it
cannot increaſe, even as to bring divers, or two, five, or ten
into one bankery, or elſe if they be not made one, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
multiply and increaſe; ſo that one talent is made known
what it is in all the reſt, in reſpect of its grace and riches, in
multiplication and increaſe, and all the reſt are made known
in that one, in reſpect of that unity, and ſume total they all
amount unto; And unto whomſoever this myſtery is not
opened they cannot be fruitful nor profitable ſervants in the

opportunity of his ſo acting, intimated in that phraſe
(in this world) or this preſent world, that is in that preſent
time or ſeaſon, <hi>nor ſhal it be forgiven in the world to come</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Mat, 12 32</note>;
that is, in the ſucceſſion and continuation of ſuch operations
for ever, which do ſucceed in the hearts of all wicked men,
and are ever coming on as truly as they are alſo preſent.
Now to ſpeak againſt this ſpiritual ſtate of Chriſt, cannot
have pardon in it; it is not meant of ſpeaking againſt the
Holy ghoſt as a ſpirit abſtracted from the Son of man, but
in that Son of man, ſo that to ſpeak of Chriſt aright is to
ſpeak of him ſpiritually, or elſe we pierce him and ſtrike
through the Spirit, that is, we leave that bleſſed operation
of the Spirit (which is all one with pardon of ſin) liveleſs
unto our ſelves; therefore when ſins are forgiven we riſe
up and walk<note n="c" place="margin">Luk, 5, 23, 24</note>, as having both pardon and power beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon and given unto us: And here we muſt note, that
we ſpeak not of Chriſt ſpiritually (but in way of piercing)
when we ſpeak of him as <hi>God,</hi> and that in the moſt acute
and ſublime manner that poſſibly art may bring forth, and
yet debate upon him as a thing abſtracted from humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and do not declare diſtinctly in all points how this <hi>God</hi>
was made man, <hi>and dwelt, or tabernacled amongſt us, or in
us, as the word is,</hi> that is, in our nature: So alſo if we ſpeak
of him in his humane nature, if we had the skil of all
Philoſophers, or the moſt curious naturaliſts that ever
were, to delineate and lay out the nature and conſtitution
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64158:110"/>
of that nature which <hi>the word was made</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Iohn 1, 14.</note>, or became in us;
and yet not declare in all points how it is made one with, or
becomes the Son of the living God; we ſpeak not ſpiritually
of Jeſus Chriſt, for nature doth afford moſt curious appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
and diſtinctions of attributes and operations, ſo be it
they may be kept a part, ſeparated and divided from the creature;
ſo as to have his ſubſiſtance and being, as that which is another
thing, apart from humane nature; ſo alſo man may attain to
excellent knowledg of the creature to apprehend, and freely
conſent unto the nature of man, diſpoſition, parts, faculties,
properties, and operations, ſo be it, he may center the proper
ſubſiſtance and being of them in the creature, and not in the
Son of God; but this is not <hi>the wounding of Kings</hi> here
ſpoken of, but to pierce the ſpiritual and holy compoſition that
is in Jeſus Chriſt; for the divine nature is never ſpoken of,
according to that ſpirit of faith<note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor, 4, 13. 1 Cor, 6, 17, Rom, 10, 8. 1 Cor, 12, 3.</note>, but as it hath reſpect unto
our nature, comprehended in that Son of man; ſo as that,
whatſoever it is, it is it in that our nature; nor is humanity
ever ſpoken of according to that life of faith, but as it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
in all things to that divine nature, comprehended, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
in that Son of God, in whom it is, whatſoever it is,
that is good and acceptable unto God; therefore to preach the
way of the Goſpel, the Croſs of Chriſt, is a piercing, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
through, and leaving deſtitute of life all the things that
ſeem glorious in the eyes of man naturally, in the ways of
God<note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet, 23, 24, 25. 1 Cor, 29, 30, 31.</note>, whether they be things, that according to the judgment
of man, recommend us unto God, in making us conformable;
unto him<note n="g" place="margin">Gen, 3, 5, 6.</note>, or things of penalty, vexation, and ſorrow, that
according to humane apprehenſion ſerve to fit and prepare us,
and make way for that which wil be approved of by him, for
the Goſpel leaves not any thing of the one nor of the other for
man to ſhroud himſelf under, or to boaſt of, or to terrifie, or
torment himſelf about; for the miſeries of man being the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
of the Son of <hi>God,</hi> muſt needs be done away; nor
can the excellency, or the goodlineſs of man take place, becauſe
the glory of the Son of God in his exaltation muſt, and doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

doth make it a day of wrath unto himſelf, for that two ſuch
contrary things ſhould be in the ſame act, the wiſdom and
deepeſt pollicy that is in man can never yeeld unto or find out,

lives, that are multiplyed in Jeſus Chriſt, ſignified in that, But
alſo to declare that there was, two different, ways of life, and
generation, included in that one act, (as certainly, as there
was both a man, and a woman included in it) the one direct
in oppoſition unto the other, that is, there is a way life in that
act, that hath nothing but death in it, and that <hi>is to live after

therefore it is not but with reſpect unto him, which the

this point lies that myſtery of the devill, and of that firſt ſin,
and ſo the myſtery of iniquity<note n="g" place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 7</note>, which the world hath ſo
many conjectures, and divining cups to drink in, to come to
the knowledge of it, and that they might finde it out, and
yet know not the time of the creation of him, whom they
ſay was firſt in ſin, nor the manner of it, that is, whether
all fell in one, or whether ſuch a multitude were in the
ſame minde in one act, or moment of time: nor know
they the place where they fell, whether in heaven, being
that ſinne cannot be admitted there, no not for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though but in the very conception of it<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 5. 4 Iſa. 53. 9</note>; and to caſt
him out before could not ſtand with juſtice, and to ſay they
fell (being out of heaven) in the garden as Miniſters unto

Creator, in whom all things conſiſt, not having their being

once the good Angells had being out of Chriſt, then they
ever have their being out of Chriſt; for his myſticall body
cannot change<note n="c" place="margin">Iam. 1. 16 17</note>: and if they be not in him, then is not he
<hi>the reconciler of all things in heaven and in earth</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Col. 1. 20</note>; therefore
the world conjectures and gropes in theſe things (namely in
this point of the fall of Angells) onely in the dark: for the
Scripture ſaith, <hi>the Angells that kept not their firſt eſtate,</hi> or
principality (<hi>as the word is</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Iude 6. verſe.</note>) are <hi>reſerved in chaines of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64158:115"/>
unto the judgement of the great day.</hi> So that if in caſe
they had principality, as the Spirit of God affirmes, then
was there none above nor before that perſon, or being that
firſt fell, no more then there was any ever below, or more
deep in deſcention then that perſon or ſubſiſtance that is the
firſt and prime in Reſurrection and exaltation, and as that
nature in the Son of God, wherein he had his deſcention,
and depth of his humiliation, hath no cauſe of boaſting or
attributing unto it ſelfe any thing in that ſtate of life and
ſalvation<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 28, 29</note>, ſo alſo that nature, wherein Satan or that Son

(wherein he was in the beginning that Lucifer, ſon of the

which our conjecturers or dreamers do dreame of or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;
therefore it is that it is ſaid, <hi>that he hath not put in

or are Miniſters<note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 2. 5.</note> to prove that the Son of God is not onely
an Angell or Meſſenger of the Covenant<note n="k" place="margin">Mal. 3. 1.</note> (which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

whom none hath power to queſtion or contradict, <hi>and if the

                  <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 10. 15. Rom. 11. 16</note>; for it hath not

unto all others; and of this Argument in that firſt Chapter
of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, our Apoſtle doth wholly
inſiſt, proving that Chriſt is not onely an Angell or Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

that as truly as Chriſt is a true Lord and giver of that Law

                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:64158:116"/>
ſo as to give every thing its due proportion, then as it is
true, that if we will give <hi>the Man of God</hi> his due proportion
in the Houſe of the Lord<note n="q" place="margin">Rev. 11. 1. Rev. 21. 15.</note>, we muſt not finde it elſe-where

hold proportion with that onely <hi>Angell of the Covenant,</hi>
and further then we can declare how they do agree, we ſet
forth no Angell or Meſſenger of God, for hee is the true
patterne in that alſo; ſo that if we give the good Angells a
nature, Miniſtery, and office beſides, or otherwiſe then is
found in the Angell of the Covenant, we wander from the

we been with <hi>Moſes in that Mount of God to ſee,</hi> nor can

nor indeed can the reſt of the holy Scriptures be knowne or

and that they muſt come to build, re-edifie, and ſet up that
holy Worſhip, before we can looke for it in the perfect pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and glory thereof; we may as well conclude, that all
things according to the Letter and Hiſtories of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
alluded unto by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, muſt againe
appeare in that worke, for the Apoſtle affirmes in as
plaine termes (as of any other of theſe ancient things

<hi>that Chriſt came to build up the Tabernacle of David</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Act. 15. 15. 16.</note>:
but this is alwaies that ancient errour of the piercing and

                  <note n="m" place="margin">Mal. 4, 5. Mat. 11. 14.</note>, they looke for the ſame

or elſe they thinke no great work can be looked for or
ſeen even as at this day ſom look for Chriſt to come to raign
as a great Monarch upon the earth, before they can injoy
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64158:118"/>
or find peace, and true Religion together, which declares
that it is a carnall peace, and an earthly Religion and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
they ſo much adore and looke after: but we know
that Chriſt told them, <hi>that Elias was then preſent,</hi> (according
to the mind and ſenſe of the <hi>Prophet</hi>) if they could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it,<note n="o" place="margin">Mar. 9. 13 Mat. 11. 14.</note>, <hi>but it was a Myſterie hid from them, becauſe the

                  <note n="p" place="margin">2 Cor: 4: 4</note>.
Such is the Hiſtory, carriage, and practice of the Jew and
Gentile, (in the true ſenſe and ſcope of holy Scriptures) as
that it is a Doctrine containing ſuch a myſtery as is ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and evidently appeares where ever Chriſt, that holy
one of God, is declared, ſet forth, and opened what he is
in our nature, which is from its firſt Originall (in him) alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
and eſtranged from what naturally it is, therefore the
Apoſtle teaching the very ſame Doctrine of the Jew and the
Gentile, tels us, <hi>he would in no caſe have us ignorant of this
Myſtery</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 11. 24, 25.</note>, leaſt we be proud and arrogate ſomewhat unto
our ſelves<note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 11. 25.</note>; ſo that the Doctrine of the Jew and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
is a myſtery or hidden thing, which is onely truely open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, and not in ſeeing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with a bodily eye to travell from one part of the world
into another, <hi>in whom they are reconciled and made one,</hi> (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
God and man, who by nature are at the greateſt diſtance

                  <note n="t" place="margin">Eph. 2. 1. 2 Rom. 3, 9.</note>, therefore he ſaith, <hi>that the Redeemer comes out

is in the declaration of the holineſs of the Jew, and

ſum, namely, to declare what the Son of God is made in us,

that whileſt we are looking with ſtretched-out necks into
the peoples of the world, expecting ſome great worke and

and reject thoſe kind offers of mercy and ſolicitations of
our ſoules which God (in that way of Chriſt) offers unto us

and yet that was the ſigne of the Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi>

acknowledged God aright in his wonderfull workes,

even as the Jewes did in the dayes of our Lord; ſo in like
manner if we ſtand gazing after an old people of the Jewes
to bring us truth, and the fulneſſe of the Gentiles to bring

                  <note n="m" place="margin">Col. 3. 3, 4. Iohn 1. 4. to 9.</note> we
ſhall prove ſuch, as upon whom the vertue and power of
that Son of God doth not appear, nor make it ſelfe manifeſt,
but ſhall be oppoſers of his gracious and ſpirituall preſence,
when ever he is truly revealed and opened among us, though
in the meane time <hi>we are puffed up by a fleſhly minde</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Col. 2. 18.</note> through
carnall ſpeculations of things that are paſt, and vaine hopes

uſe but meerly to flatter our ſelves in a looſe and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

them unto our ſelves in) nor in that ſenſe which we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
and take them in, appeare nor manifeſt themſelves nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unto our ſelves nor unto others; therefore it is, that
God hath ſo varied the outward forme of the expreſſing of
himſelfe in his Word from firſt to laſt, till at the length he
hath ſo propounded himſelf unto us, that all the men in the
world cannot give the outward forme of it to reſemble
it in the leaſt, but a meer carnall eye can ſee it is deceit, and
cannot be the ſame, as in that Booke of the Revelations it
doth ſo evidently appeare, or elſe we had had (by the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64158:119"/>
of this world) <hi>all the ſeven Trumpets ſounded long ago,
as alſo that new Jeruſalem erected and ſet up,</hi> which now wee
fall ſhort of, and according to their underſtanding of the
Word of God ever muſt, and ſo muſt ever drive it ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
yeares before them, as ſo long they have done to the
deceiving and deluding of ſo many that are gone downe
in the meane time into <hi>Hades:</hi> nor ſhall theſe perſons or
Spectators, looking after things at ſuch a diſtance of time,
from them, attaine their hopes, no more then the Jewes did
<hi>in having Elia appeare againe unto them</hi> in that forme, or in
that ſenſe which they underſtood the Prophet in; ſo that
ſuch waiters and expectors for great things in after times,
(but lay the Saints waſt of them at the preſent) they doe
ever waite with the ſame Spirit which the Jewes did, and
whilſt they are looking for other Jews, are performing that
ancient office <hi>of the Jewe; themſelves, and of the Gentiles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>

of Gods Government, Dominion, and Rule in his Saints
<hi>which are ſaid here to be the Heathen or the Aliens,</hi> there is that
which in it ſelfe is death, darkneſſe, ſlavery and ſubjection
unto the leaſt and worſt things in the world, yet is it aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
eſtranged, and cut off therefrom, and hath nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
in it but life, light, liberty and dominion <hi>over all

                  <note n="r" place="margin">Eph. 2. 2. 2 Cor. 4. 4.</note>,
and are nothing at all of ſuch a thing as by nature in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
they are; ſo that as God is nothing to the wicked but
what he is onely in and by them, and therefore hee is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them, <hi>for God is not in all their thoughts</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Pſal. 10. 4</note>, even ſo
the Saints are nothing to God, but onely what they are in
him <hi>which is all things, and therefore in the multitude of their
thoughts within them, they are all his comforts which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
their ſoules</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 94. 19.</note>. So that in Gods Rule and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
in the wicked there is nothing of him but what
ſpringeth and cometh of themſelves, who are nothing
of God at all, and in Gods rule and domination, in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64158:120"/>
there is nothing in them but what is of him who is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in himſelfe, that is in reſpect of his owne nature,
that is any thing of them at all, this therefore is that great
Myſtery of the Goſpell which hath laine hidden from the
world in Ages that are paſt, that God who in his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cannot be more excellent and glorious in one place,
perſon, or action, then in another, yet in his wiſdome hath
ſo provided in Chriſt, <hi>that the place wherein he hath appointed

God who in his owne nature, cannot bee abſent from, or

that the men and operations of this world are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and alſo as conſpicuous as Chriſt himſelfe is, and of no

us<note n="c" place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 7 1 Tim. 3. 16</note>, and hence is that other particular in his rule and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
brought in by our Prophet, that is by what hee
judgeth, which is ſaid to be this:</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>By filling the places with dead bodies, or (as ſome tranſlate
it) hee ſhall fill up with ruines.</head>
               <p>The Word tranſlated <hi>fill,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſignifies to fulfill or to fill
up, that is, to make a thing full by expending, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
away another; for nothing can bee filled with
two things, to have its fullneſſe of each of them, but
if it bee filled up, or made full with any one thing,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64158:120"/>
all other things muſt bee expunged, expended, and
put out or paſſed away, or an end muſt bee made of
them, as the word will beare, and therefore ſo much is
in the words, as perfectly to plead a cauſe ſo as to put
an end to all hopes of ever impleading to the contrary,
with any advantage, and ſo doth give life unto him,
in whoſe behalf it is impleaded, for it comes of a word that
ſignifies to live, the word tranſlated dead bodies, or ruins,
deſtruction, loſſe or miſery, comes of a word that ſignifies
to fall, or to be dead, or come into extream decay, that is
decay even unto the uttermoſt, ſo that the ſenſe runs
thus: hee ſhall fill up with ruines, or hee ſhall perfectly
plead, to recover with loſſe; or he ſhall cauſe to live by
death, or to riſe by the fall, or to reſtore all things by an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
decay of them; and in this the Prophet alludes unto
that death, deſtruction, and way of the fall of man in the
beginning, without which, <hi>man had never lived the life
of God in Ieſus Chriſt</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Ger. 3. 3. Gen. 3. 9 to 19. 2 Cor. 5. 21</note>; nor had hee beene ſaved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
from an utter deſtruction and decay: nay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which fall <hi>Hee had never beene raiſed and lifted up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the glory of the Father</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 4. 9, 10.</note>: So that wee cannot looke
upon the fall with an eye of faith in the wiſdome of
God, but wee muſt of neceſſity behold Chriſt <hi>the image
and wiſdome of the Father in it,</hi> from which man fell, no
more then wee can behold the reſurrection by faith in

                  <note n="f" place="margin">Iſa. 26. 19 Iſa. 60. 1, 2.</note>: So that however the fall is properly taught in the

So that in the fall of man, <hi>the humiliation and life of the</hi>

that aſpiring ſpirit and life of man is involved, <hi>whereby man

                  <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 3. 5, 6 Hoſ. 13. 9.</note>: Now the fall
of man is the death and humiliation of the Son of God on

of a creature, made one with God, cannot admit of
any thing into unity with it ſelfe whoſe life and excellency
is not the ſame with that which is in it ſelfe, for the nature
of man being made one with the Image or Son of God<note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 1. 27. Gen. 4. 1, 2.</note>,
cannot propoſe it ſelfe unto it ſelfe in its native excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
below, or inferiour unto God, for the nature of man
being made one with God, according to the beſt perfections
and wiſdome of a creature, wherein he was as truly made
as in the wiſdome and perfections of God, and according
to that humane wiſdome of his, he cannot admit of any
thing in, himſelfe (that is in his owne nature) to bee leſſe
then the excellencies of the Creator, being <hi>he was made in

is no excellency in the creature, unto which the heart of

ſome excellency from it whereby to commend himſelf unto

God unto it ſelfe as another thing then that which

and thence he makes himſelfe miſerable and reſtleſſe, even as
a thing that hath no ſtay or ſubſtance to reſt upon, and in it

had nothing but the arme of fleſh to come againſt them

                  <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 11. 26.</note> ſo that to a narrow ſtrait of infringement

or into a large place of dominion, or of diſcerning of all things,
as our nature is made one with that potent and all-ſeing eye of

<hi>or in this ſtrait and narrow place is the place of his freedome and

in the eſteeme of man are honourable, but out of things that
are baſe and vile he cannot doe it, and upon this ground our

in naming of and ſeeing into the nature of every one of them

and in the earth, yea and under the earth,</hi> yea even ſuch as
are made lower then properly the earthly or naturall condition
of a creature is<note n="y" place="margin">Iude 10. verſe. 2 Pet. 2. 12.</note>, and hence it is, that our Apoſtle reaſon from
that eighth Pſalm, <hi>thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under his
feet</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 8. 6.</note>: <hi>now in that he ſaith, all things are put under, he left nothing,
or nothing was exempted that was not put under him</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 2. 7, 8</note>; ſo that the
exaltation of Chriſt is that wherewith the Son of man or the
humane nature is dignified, otherwiſe it could not be <hi>a putting
of things under him,</hi> if in caſe they were ſo by nature; for all
things are under him by nature, as he is God<note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 1. 1, 2, 3. Rom. 9. 5. Gen. 1. 1.</note>, and therefore in
that reſpect cannot admit of an action of putting them <hi>or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them to be ſo,</hi> for it is impoſſible that the Creator ſhould
be otherwiſe in himſelfe <hi>but above the workes of his hand</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Iſa. 45. 11 12.</note>, as
our Apoſtle reaſons from <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt, <hi>that as he that builds
the houſe is greater and more honourable then that which is built</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 3. 3, 4</note>,
ſo is it in this caſe, for nothing can be ſaid to be put under
Chriſt as he is God, ſeeing all things are ſo (without gain ſaying)
by nature, therefore the exaltation is properly of the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and not of the Divinity which indeed <hi>is height it ſelfe</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 7. 26.</note>,
though it be exalted onely in and by the Divinity, even as the
humiliation is properly of the divine nature and not of the
humane, for the humane nature cannot be lower then it is by
nature in it ſelfe, being in the fall <hi>become a curſe</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13. 2 Cor. 15. 22.</note>, but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature is onely humbled and made low in and by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, for in it ſelfe it can admit of no ſuch thing<note n="g" place="margin">Mal. 3. 6.</note>, and
therefore the humiliation is of an infinite value and extent,
which makes our Apoſtle to adde thoſe words, <hi>and yet we ſee
not all things put under him</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 2. 8.</note>, which to a naturall eye or eare
ſeems a plaine contradiction, the words are, <hi>we ſee not all things,</hi>
or <hi>we ſee not any particular thing whatſoever</hi> under or below him,
for it being the humiliation of the Son of God it was to the
greateſt and utmoſt degree of debaſement, ſo that nothing was
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64158:135"/>
or could be lower then that condition was, which he tooke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, for if there had, then had he fallen ſhort of a perfect
and abſolute <hi>overcoming and vanquiſhing of ſin and death,</hi> and
then had our ſalvation failed, therefore ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>Chriſt
was made a little lower then the Angells, and in ſuffering of death
crowned with glory and honour</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note>, <hi>that he by the grace, favour, or
mutuall imbracings of God,</hi> as the word ſignifies, might in man,
that is, in our nature <hi>taſte and feel death in all,</hi> or in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
part, way, or kinde of it<note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note>, being made ſo low as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be lower, therefore he adds, <hi>that the Captaine of our
ſalvation is made perfect through ſufferings</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 2. 10.</note>: Such and ſo many
and great as the glory of his exaltation is in bringing ſons to
glory anſwerable to that is his debaſement in that condition,
out of which he fetcheth and taketh them, therefore in the
way of his humiliation doth he lift up his head, and is exalted
for ever. To this comes that of the Apoſtle, when hee ſaith
then or henceforth the end, finiſhing, accompliſhment or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
(as the word tranſlated end ſignifies and denotes unto
us) <hi>when he ſhall deliver up the Kingdome to God even the father</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 24.</note>,
or when he hath given up or put into the hands, put into truſt
or yeelded all regallity and Soveraignty to be in and onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto him, who is the father of all dignity, excellencie, and
power, at which time or in that very act of yeelding or giving
all unto God, he doth evacuate, empty, or make void the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all rule, authority, and power in all things whatſoever
that concernes the glory and dignity of the Kingdom of God,
<hi>for he muſt</hi> or it is expedient and needfull, yea <hi>he doth raigne ſtill,</hi>
or<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 25.</note> to the end <hi>to put downe all his enemies under his feet,</hi> this is
the very end of his raigne to put all Gods enemies under foot,
now whatſoever is in man by nature, is an adverſary, yea is in
hoſtility, as the word ſignifies, againſt God, therefore the reign
of Chriſt muſt of neceſſity bring under, or elſe he were not a
perfect victor, overcomer, and conquerour over all, and then
could not he obtaine the glory of the Son of God, therefore
he adds, <hi>that the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 26.</note>; by
this word laſt is meant the baſeſt or the loweſt of enemies, and
it is the loweſt and baſeſt in that it deſtroyes, ruinates and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ſpoiles it ſelfe, therefore the word tranſlated deſtroy, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64158:136"/>
unthriftineſſe, to the undoing and loſſe of it ſelfe, for the
Son of God is made ſo low by the ſuffering of death, as that
the death comes into competition and ingagement with the
life of the Son of God, and ſo muſt of neceſſity conſume,
waſte, ruinate, and looſe it ſelfe, being that the Son of God
muſt live eternally, elſe he were not God, <hi>and ſo death is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up in victory</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 54.</note>, hence it is that the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes ſo ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly,
<hi>thou haſt put all things under his feet, all ſheep and oxen,
yea and the beaſt of the field, foules of the ayre, and fiſh in the ſea,
that paſſe through the paths of it</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 8. 6, 7, 8.</note>, this is mans Lordſhip, and
according to the naturall workings of his mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
hee perceives his dominion as he is a man, when hee
comes into competiton with the inferiour, ſenſuall and terrene
creatures, they ſerving to this end, namely to give dimention,
and to manifeſt the nobility and excellency of that ſpirit which
the Creator had indued him withall, by which he ſaw that Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and dominion which he had over them all, being they
were all made in ſubjection unto him, and farre under and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
him, therefore <hi>could he not finde a fit companion or conſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
for himſelfe amongſt them all</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 2. 20.</note>; this man can doe by that
naturall and common underſtanding which he hath implanted
in him, even as he is a creature, and in this death doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
conſiſt, therefore no ſpeech of death whilſt he is ſaid to
be converſant in and about theſe things, that is ſimply to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the creature in his thoughts, words, or actions: but when
this naturall underſtanding (proper unto man ſimply as he is a
creature) workes upon and is converſant in and about the
things of the Creator, then by how much the more hee would
be like his Creator which ſo farre tranſcends and is above all
the creatures in the world, by ſo much is he debaſed, and made
under and below all creatures in the world, and this is that
death which is deſtroyed<note n="s" place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 14 1 Cor. 15. 54, 55, 56, 57.</note>, for being a death of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when ever wee looke upon it by that light and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the Spirit, that comes onely <hi>from that Father
of lights,</hi> then is it in this, as in that former way of nature,
ſo now in this way of grace, for this death, ſerves to no other
end, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> but to mete out, <hi>as with a metwand or meaſuring line</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Rev. 11. 1.</note>, to
give dimenſion unto that life that is in the Son of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64158:136"/>
by he ſees the height of his Soveraignty, dominion and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
for ever, which without it could never appeare, nor bee
made manifeſt in a creature, but muſt of neceſſity have been hid
and lodged in himſelfe for ever; and then had not <hi>his goodneſſe
appeared</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Tit. 2. 11. Pſal. 39. 19. 19.</note>; and if not his goodneſſe, then <hi>not his light</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 5.</note>, and
<hi>that light which appeares not is darkneſſe</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 6. 23.</note>; <hi>and if God ſhould not
be light, he were no God at all</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 9, 10, 11.</note>: and thus uncontrouleable, and
without all controverſie, doubt or ſcruple, doth God convince
our hearts of that breaking forth, <hi>and revelation of himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us in the face of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6</note>: and hereby doth death, being
made ſo low, extinguiſh, put out, vanquiſh, and deſtroy it ſelfe
for ever, in that it ſets out that life and light, which is in that
faith of the Sonne of God, which otherwiſe could not appeare
to, or in the Saints: and of ſuch uſe is that unto the Saints, and
choſen of God, as to lift them up unto life, and light, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
for ever, through that wiſdome which is in God, which is
nothing els but the <hi>King of terrour to all the men of the world,</hi>
who look upon the things of God with a naturall and carnall
eye<note n="b" place="margin">Iob. 18. 5. to 21.</note>; for <hi>Chriſt by drinking of the brooke in the way, is exalted
as head, governour and ruler over all,</hi> which thing the world is
not aware of, neither will it know and underſtand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can never give Chriſt the honour of his death, nor confeſſe
the excellency, glory, fruit, profit and comfort of the croſſe of
our Lord<note n="c" place="margin">Gal 6. 14 Iam. 1. 2, 3, 4. 2 Cor. 12 9 10. Rom. 8. 35, 36, 37.</note>. The exaltation then of the Son of God is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of himſelfe, from the depth of that low eſtate of his
humiliation, which he hath onely in man, which gives dimenſion
unto it, in its height, for ever; and the humiliation of the Son
of man is the beholding of himſelfe, in or from the height and
dignity which he hath in God, and that gives dimenſion to his
low eſtate, out of which he riſeth, and ſilenceth the <hi>fleſh from
uttering or conceiving of the leaſt cauſe of boaſting for ever</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 27. to 31.</note>:
Therefore the Pſalmiſt when he <hi>beholds the heavens, the worke of
the finger of God, the moone and the ſtarres, which thou haſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 8. 3.</note>;
from the conſideration of the heavenly bodies, and works
of God for him, or in him; thence doth ariſe his humiliation
and abaſements, therefore he ſaith, <hi>what is man,</hi> (or, <hi>what is it
man</hi>) in way of admiration, <hi>that thou conſiderest him,</hi> or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breſt
him<note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 8. 4.</note>? For the word ſignifies to memorize, or begin
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64158:137"/>
againe: as if he ſhould ſay, doſt thou that art ſo high and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
yea ſo full of varieties of excellencies, and glory, even as
the Moone and the Starres are in themſelves<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 41.</note>: Doſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
or take thy beginning in man? for as the Son of God
is eternall, and ſo without beginning, or time, as he is God, ſo is
he alſo in time, and takes a beginning as he is man, and this puts
man to ſilence, for ever opening his mouth in any excellencies
of the creature, in the things of God, when once he ſees how
the Eternall takes a beginning in him<note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 8. 4.</note>; and ſo (as the word
will beare) memorizeth and eternizeth himſelfe in ſuch a fraile
and momentany thing as man is, even as the heavens are monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentized
in the earth, without which their vertue, glory and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
could never be ſeene, nor made knowne<note n="i" place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 21, 22. Pſal. 65. 9. to 13.</note>; therefore
he adds thoſe words, <hi>viſiteſt him,</hi> or makeſt him the object of
thy conſtant act, of ſight, and aſpect, even as the Sun looks
forth upon the earth, for the continuall revivall, refreſhment,
fruitfulneſſe, and glory of it, without which it were altogether
barren and undone. Yea the Apoſtle adds further, <hi>He hath put
all things under his feet</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 2. 8.</note>: <hi>Now if all things be put under him, it
is evident that he is excepted, that did ſubject them, and put them
under:</hi> yea, he muſt be ſuch a one, that doth ſubject them, who
is over all: ſo that all things in that loſt eſtate by mankinde, are
infinitely below, and beneath Chriſt as he is God, and all things
as they are in God, are infinitely above Chriſt Jeſus as he is man,
and ſo ſuſtaines the nature of that loſt condition: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both the humiliation and exaltation are complete and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in him alone: <hi>For when all things are made ſubject unto, and
ſubdued under him,</hi> as he is man, by another, <hi>which is God, bleſſed
for ever</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 9. 5.</note>; that is, by another, in nature, not in ſubſiſtence and
being. Now he that ſubjects and brings all things under, muſt
needs in himſelfe be above all things, and ſo above him, unto
whom they are ſubjected, as he is man; and therefore cannot in
the leaſt (as he is man) ſubject, or ſubdue, no more then God
himſelfe can be brought low or under, in reſpect of himſelfe, or
his owne nature: no more can the nature of man ſubdue the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of our ſalvation, by any thing that is in, or of himſelfe,
that is, in, or of his own nature: As a creature therefore muſt
needs be ſubject in himſelfe, unto him that ſubdues all things;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64158:137"/>
and ſo the Son himſelfe, as he is man, is ſubject unto the Father
as he is God<note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 17 27, 28.</note>; and yet the ſubmiſſion, or ſubjection of the Son
is not, but in the Father; nor is the authority and rule of the
Father, but onely in the Son; ſo that the ſubmiſſion and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
are not found elſwhere, but onely in one and the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
and being, and hence it is, that God is <hi>all in all</hi> in every
one of the Saints, and they onely paſſive in themſelves or in
their owne nature<note n="n" place="margin">Iſa. 30. 7. Phil. 2. 13.</note>, but powerfull and operative in their Lord,
or in and through that nature divine for ever, even as he is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
active in himſelfe and his owne nature, but became paſſive
in them or in their nature, and ſubject to death, which in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
could never be, and yet is the one and the other reall and
true, the operation, life, and reſurrection that is in that Word
and Son of the Father, is as really and truly ours, <hi>and we worke
and live, and riſe from the dead by it</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Col. 2. 13. Rom. 8. 11. Rom. 4. 17.</note>; as or weakneſſe, death,
and low eſtate is really his, <hi>ſo as he ſuffered death and deſcended
in and by it,</hi> and therefore our Apoſtle affirmes, <hi>that he that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends
is the ſame that deſcends into the lowermoſt parts of the earth</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 9</note>,
and this is the humiliation and exaltation of our Lord made
one, no leſſe abſolute and true <hi>then that the divine and humane
nature are one Chriſt, or one ſubſiſtance and Son of God the Saviour
of the world,</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>elſe what ſhall
they do,</hi> or (as the word may be read) <hi>what ſhall he do that is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
for dead, if the dead riſe not</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 15 29.</note>, or as the meaning is, if death
be not life, the deſcention the reſurrection, what ſhall he doe?
or <hi>how can he be the Son of God?</hi> for if death be not made life
in the very act of it, in that way of Chriſt, otherwiſe the Son
could never be <hi>baptized with the baptiſme of death</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Luke 12. 50.</note>, if that
death were not in that very act transformed into life, he could
not be the Son of God, for <hi>he cannot be held of death no not for
a moment</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Acts 2. 24</note>, for then he were not God, therefore doth our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<hi>Gideon</hi> and all his ſouldiers in him or with him, yea our
